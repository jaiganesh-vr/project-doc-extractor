OLKHOVaTKa, Russia — The bus 
from the front lines ground to a halt 
outside the roadside kitchen, and the 
soldiers on board limped out into the 
winter mud.
Most were missing feet or a leg.
A water bottle filled with blood 
swung precariously from a plastic 
tube attached to one soldier’s stom-
ach as he was helped toward a bench. 
Another stared blankly at the blood-
ied stump where his right hand had 
once been.
“I would never have signed a con-
tract if I’d known what it’s like out 
there. our television is lying to us,” 
said Fyodor, a young soldier from 
siberia. Like others in this article, 
The Washington Post is not identify-
ing him by his full name to protect 
him from any repercussions for criti-
cizing the war.
Fyodor had his lower leg blown off 
by a mine two days previously during 
an advance on Lyman in Ukraine 
with what remained of his unit. He 
said he was one of just 10 people left 
of the 110-strong unit he joined two 
years ago.
He had no regrets over the loss of 
his leg. “It means that I can finally go 
home — alive.”
“We’re fighting for fields that we 
cannot even take,” interjected a fel-
low soldier, Kirill, also in his 20s, 
laughing wryly. “This war will never

Richard smallwood, a singer-
songwriter and pianist who be-
came a chart-topping stalwart of 
gospel music, writing songs that 
were performed by artists in-
cluding Destiny’s Child and 
Whitney Houston, died Dec. 30 
at a nursing center in sandy 
spring, Maryland. He was 77.
The cause was complications 
from kidney failure, said his 
publicist Bill Carpenter.
A longtime Washingtonian 
who fused music and ministry, 
Mr. smallwood wrote uplifting, 
classically 
informed 
church 
songs that spread a message of 
faith and love. He was perhaps 
best known for “Total Praise,” a 
church choir staple covered by 
Destiny’s Child and stevie Won-
der, and “I Love the Lord,” a 
soaring anthem that Houston 
popularized on the soundtrack of 
the 1996 film “The Preacher’s 
Wife.”
As a songwriter, Mr. small-
wood crafted melodies that 
bridged past and present, reflect-
ing his upbringing in the church 
(he played piano for his step -
father’s Baptist congregations); 
his love of baroque composer 
Johann sebastian Bach; and his 
interest in the Motown soul that 
blanketed the radio in his youth.
Even with those pop influenc-
es, he considered himself far 
more than an entertainer.
“This is not about making 
money,” he told The Washington 
Post in 2015. “It’s about winning 
souls and encouraging people

The U.s. military announced 
Tuesday that it had killed seven 
Islamic state members and cap-
tured more than a dozen as it 
continues to put pressure on 
the terror group in syria, weeks 
after an ambush there killed 
two Iowa National Guard sol-
diers.
The missions to kill or capture 
the fighters occurred from Dec. 
20 to Dec. 29 and directly fol-
lowed large-scale U.s. and Jorda-
nian airstrikes on Dec. 19 that hit 
more than 70 Islamic state tar-
gets across the country in re-
sponse to the attack on U.s. 
forces at a military base in 
Palmyra earlier this month.
The U.s. has maintained a 
military presence of roughly 
1,000 troops in syria as the 
transitional 
government 
has 
struggled to control all of the 
country’s territory and quell spo-
radic violence following the top-
pling of the former president, 
Bashar al-Assad, by rebel forces 
led by the current president, 
Ahmed al-sharaa, in December 
2024.
In the months since, the U.s. 
military’s role in syria has been 
transitioning to support the new 
government’s efforts to reestab-
lish security after years of train-
ing and fighting alongside part-
ner forces.
At its height, the Islamic state 
controlled a wide swath of terri-
tory stretching across Iraq and 
syria. Last year, U.s. Central 
Command estimated that some

The Department of Homeland 
security is seeking to fast-track 
the demolition of more than a 
dozen historic buildings at st. 
Elizabeths in southeast Washing-
ton, asserting that the conditions 
of the vacant structures represent 
an “emergency” and pose poten-
tial security risks, according to 
documents obtained by The 
Washington Post.
Homeland security secretary 
Kristi L. Noem, in a Dec. 19 memo 
to the General services Adminis-
tration, said the buildings “con-
stitute a present risk to life and 
property” on the 176-acre West 
Campus, a fortified complex that 
Homeland security has been 
transforming into its new head-
quarters over the past 15 years.
“Demolition is the only perma-
nent measure that resolves the 
emergency conditions,” Noem 
wrote in the memo. A risk assess-
ment report undertaken by her 
agency “supports immediate cor-
rective action,” she wrote.
The assessment report, which 
Noem included with her memo, 
concludes the vacant buildings 
“may be accessed by unauthor-
ized individuals seeking to cause 
harm to personnel.” The struc-
tures “provide a tactical advan-
tage for carrying out small arms 
or active shooter scenarios,” the 
report states.

on his way to being confirmed 
as the nation’s top health official, 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised 
lawmakers he would do nothing 
that “makes it difficult or discour-
ages people from taking vac-
cines.”
Almost 100 days into the job, 
amid rising measles outbreaks 
and congressional scrutiny of his 
messaging on vaccines, Kennedy 
made clear behind the scenes that 
he wanted to reshape the nation’s 
immunization system.
Kennedy, the founder of a 
prominent anti-vaccine group, 
presented several top federal 
health officials with a new vision.
“Bobby has asked for the fol-
lowing changes,” Kennedy’s depu-
ty chief of staff for policy at the 
time, Hannah Anderson, wrote to 
the officials in a May 19 email later 
reviewed by The Washington 
Post.
Among his requests was to re-
place the entire membership of an 
influential independent commit-
tee of experts that makes recom-
mendations for how and when to 
vaccinate Americans. Kennedy 
also asked the panel to reconsider 
a long-standing recommendation 
that all newborns get a hepatitis B 
vaccine and revisit the use of 
multidose flu shot vials, which 
contain a mercury-based preser-
vative.
Anti-vaccine activists have crit-
icized those vaccines for years, 
claiming they unnecessarily en-
danger children. Career federal 
scientists who learned of Kenne-
dy’s asks said they represented a 
sea change for shots that have 
been extensively studied and 
deemed safe.
“At that point we were just 
bracing for upheaval,” said Deme-
tre Daskalakis, who was then the 
CDC’s top respiratory diseases 
and immunization official.
Kennedy would get what he 
wanted. The May 19 email reveals 
his previously undisclosed influ-
ence on some of these changes in a 
highly unusual way, according to 
legal experts and former and cur-
rent health officials, showing how 
Kennedy has wielded govern-
ment power to overhaul a public 
health system he has blasted as 
corrupt and ineffective.

for the Department of Health and 
Human services, said of the

The news can feel heavy. But
this year also brought moments of
hope, including heartening ad-
vances in dementia research and

favorite optimistic stories from
2025.
1. Schools are banning
phones — and remarkable
things are happening
For the past few years, the
lunchroomatBallardHighSchool
was a hushed place.
“You’d walk in there and every-
body had their heads down,” Prin-
cipal Jason Neuss told me this fall.
“Just scrolling.”
This year, the school in Louis-
ville implemented a bell-to-bell
phone ban. Neuss said the change
wasimmediate:Thelunchroomis
loud again.
Something else happened, too.
In the first month of school, stu-
dents took out 67 percent more
books than the same month last
year. That trend has continued for
the rest of the school year so far.
“Even my library aides who do
the bulk of the circulating were
like, ‘Gosh, there’s a lot of kids
checking out books,’” said Stepha-
nie Conrad, the school’s librarian.
Ballard is just one of a growing
number of schools that are ban-
ning cellphones. We interviewed
psychologist Jean Twenge about
bell-to-bellphonebans,whichshe
advocates for because of the aca-
demic, social and mental health
benefits of spending less time on
social media.

2. An 80-year-old woman
hiked the entire
Appalachian Trail
Here at The Optimist, we write
a lot about people who break
world records. But the story of
Betty Kellenberger was one of my
favorites — because she wasn’t
motivated by that at all.
Kellenberger finished hiking
the entire 2,197-mile Appalachian
Trail this year at 80 years old, and
she had no idea she was about to
become the oldest woman to ever
do so.
“We put all kinds of limitations
on ourselves,” Kellenberger told
mycolleagueSydneyPage.“Some-
times the biggest one is we don’t
get up and try it.”
Kellenberger had been inter-
ested in hiking the Appalachian
Trail since she was a kid.
“I was just fascinated by the
idea that you could walk from
Georgia to Maine,” said Kellen-
berger, who grew up on a farm in
Howell,Michigan.“Itwasadream
more than anything else, because
I never had the time.”
Kellenberger
was
a
middle
school teacher for decades, and
when she retired, she started
checking off her bucket list. Now
that she has completed the trail,
she hopes to go hiking in Iceland
andperhapseventackletheNorth
Country National Scenic Trail,
which runs from North Dakota to
Vermont.
“I’ll do it as long as I’m able,”
she said.

3. A bodega manager found
a way to get kids excited
about studying
In 2023, Wail Alselwi made a
bet with a young customer. He
told Zamier Davies, then 12, that if
he got good grades on his report
card, Alselwi would give him any-
thing in the store he wanted —
free.
The motivation worked. Zami-
er came back with an 88 percent
average and got a free Oreo milk-
shake. With the permission of
Zamier’s parents, Alselwi posted
on TikTok about it, and other kids
flocked to the bodega with their
report cards, too. Alselwi paid for
the goodies out of his own pocket
—untilcommentersonhisTikTok
asked to contribute. Some of the
kidschoosespecialtreats,butoth-
ers buy staples such as milk and
eggs for their families.
Alselwi said he plans to keep it
up, and he hopes that others are

4. A bear cub was rescued
and is being raised by
humans in bear suits
In April, campers in Los Padres
National Forest found a tiny baby
bear alone. He was crying, and his
mother was nowhere to be found.
At just about three pounds, ex-
perts at the San Diego Humane
Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center
said the cub was “extremely frag-
ile.” But after just five weeks in
their care, he was thriving. He
gained weight and had reached
severaldevelopmentalmilestones
— including learning to climb.
The cutest part, though, was
that the staff who cared for him
did so while dressed as bears.
The costumes weren’t just for
the incredible photos. The wild-
life center staff said that it was
importanttopreventthecubfrom
forming an attachment to hu-
mans that could be dangerous
when he is reintroduced to the
wild.
In June, the baby bear cub was
moved to Sonoma County Wild-
life Rescue to continue his reha-
bilitation with two other bear
cubs.
“Growing up together will give
these cubs the chance to learn
from one another and develop
critical natural behaviors they’ll
need to thrive in the wild,” Nina
Thompson, who’s with the San
Diego Humane Society, said in an
email to The Post. “That’s our
most important goal of all: to see
these bears go home.”

Drunk raccoons are having a
moment.

some “poor life choices,” accord-
ing to authorities.
When I saw this story, I imme-
diately thought of another couple
of drunk raccoons my colleague
Kyle Melnick wrote about earlier
this year.
After indulging in too many
fermented peaches from a nearby
distillery, the pair were rescued
from a dumpster in Kentucky by
local nurse Misty Combs.

bad shape — soaking wet, barely
breathing and reeking of moon-
shine. Her colleagues thought the
raccoon was dead.
“Not on my watch,” Combs re-
called thinking. “I’m going to try
to do whatever I can.”
Combs ended up performing
CPR on the little guy, then calling
local animal control. She and her
colleagues nicknamed the rac-
coon Otis Campbell after the
“town drunk” on the “The Andy
Griffith Show.”
After a vet helped the raccoon
recover, Combs was able to set
Otis free, back into the wild.

Politics & the Nation
BY CAROLINE O’DONOVAN
RAYToWN, Mo. — In the two 
years she has lived at Bowen 
Tower, Cynthia Barlow’s apart-
ment has flooded, been plagued 
by mold and been infested with 
cockroaches. The building’s heat 
stopped working. When the ele-
vators broke over the summer, 
emergency workers carried a sick 
neighbor down 10 flights of 
stairs.
Meanwhile, Barlow’s rent for 
the two-bedroom unit increased 
from $993 per month to $1,213.
Growing frustrated, she hung 
fliers in the elevators and hosted 
potlucks, persuading a majority 
of tenants in the 90-unit building 
to join the Bowen Tower Tenant 
Union and stop paying rent until 
conditions improved. So far, 
they’ve won a meeting with the 
landlord, and a judge has 
knocked thousands of dollars off 
the rent debt of one resident 
facing eviction.
“I got tired of being treated the 
way I was treated,” Barlow said.
The rent strike is part of a 
strategy that housing activists 
have started to replicate in mid-
size cities across the country. 
Tenant organizing is more com-
mon in liberal coastal metropo-
lises like Los Angeles and New 
York — which recently elected 
Zohran Mamdani, a former ten-
ant organizer, as its mayor.
But rent strikes have been 
almost unheard of in places like 
Kansas City, Missouri, where ac-
cording to Zillow the median rent 
increased 4.4 percent in the last 
year, twice the rate of the national 
average. Now, tenants in at least 
three buildings around the city 
have formed unions. Similar 
groups have popped up in Bozem-
an, Montana; Louisville; and 
New Haven, Connecticut.
The country’s renters are at a 
“total breaking point,” said Tara 
Raghuveer, founding director of 
the Kansas City Tenants Union, 
also known as KC Tenants, an 
activist group. “When you get 
displaced from Chicago as a ten-
ant, you might end up in a place 
like Kansas City. When you get 
displaced from Kansas City, you 
might end up in a Raytown, 
Missouri. When you get displaced 
in Raytown, Missouri, I do not 
know where … you’re supposed to 
go.”
Raghuveer said her group, 
which launched in 2019, has re-
cently honed its focus on using 
tenants’ economic leverage — 
their rent checks — to extract 
broad improvements and protec-
tions, not just for individual 
buildings but on a wide scale.
“If we are only organizing 
block by block, we are going to 
lose,” she said. “We can’t let 
ourselves be wholly consumed by 
getting the elevator fixed or even 
by getting a collectively bar-
gained lease agreement — as 
important as those things are to 
the material realities of the ten-
ants that we’re organizing. We 
have to be focused … on much 
larger-scale economic disrup-
tion.”
But there are risks. In Missouri 
— and most of the country — 
renters lack legal protections, 
and tenants like Barlow face evic-
tion and homelessness if their 
strategy fails. The California-
based real estate company Alta/
CGHS, which owns Bowen Tower, 
has sent eviction notices to 28 
tenants since the rent strike start-
ed and is refusing to renew some 
leases.
If tenants don’t pay their rent, 
eviction is inevitable, said Greg 
Salyers, a minority partner in the 
firm. Without rent checks, “you 
can’t pay your mortgage, you 
can’t pay a staff to fix things,” he 
said. “It’s a business.”
Salyers 
acknowledged 
the 
building’s maintenance issues, 
including with its heating and 
cooling systems, elevators, mold, 
plumbing and pests. But he said 
the owners have spent more than 
$1 million making repairs since 
2024, including $250,000 on 
plumbing. About five units did 
not have working heat as of 
mid-December, 
but 
residents 
were told they could be placed in 
a hotel or compensated while 
they waited for window units to 
be installed, he said. They re-
ceived a similar offer when the 
elevators stopped working for 
five days over the summer.
“We want this to be a well-run 
building with tenants who are 
happy,” Salyers said.
Salyers said the company is 
eager to work with tenants indi-
vidually, but the company refuses 
to acknowledge the Bowen Tower 
Tenant Union. And he described 
KC Tenants, which has been 
working with the group, as an 
“unethical” third party that is 
“muddying” the company’s com-
munication with tenants and 
spreading falsehoods to “smear” 
the owners. He also accused ten-
ants of delaying repairs by inten-
tionally concealing issues in their 
units from building management 
so they could be photographed 
and shared on social media to 
encourage the rent strike effort.
Barlow, 59, said that when she 
moved to Bowen Tower, it was 
advertised as a quiet place for 
people 55 and older on the border 
of Kansas City. But she found the 
red brick building, which stands 
out as the lone high-rise in an 
otherwise flat, suburban land-
scape, to be home to children and 
recently 
homeless 
families. 
Promised perks, including free 
internet and shuttle service, nev-
er materialized, Barlow said.
Many tenants spend 60 per-
cent of their income on rent, 
according to an analysis by KC 
Tenants.
Salyers said that he has been to 
the building several times and 
that some young children may 
live there, but he wasn’t aware of 
it. Those types of issues are han-
dled by the property manage-
ment company, Lynd Living, he 
said. Lynd Living did not immedi-
ately respond to a request for 
comment.
Late last year, Barlow said, she 
came home to find her apartment 
floor wet. A pipe in the wall was 
leaking, she said, and the walls 
and carpet were damp. Days later, 
as she waited for the building 
manager to make repairs, she 
said, she learned that one neigh-
bor’s leak was so bad, they had an 
overflowing barrel of water.
“I don’t care if you are home-
less,” she said. “You don’t put 
nobody in no conditions like that 
— period.”
Around that time, Barlow said, 
she watched a news report about 
tenants at an apartment building 
in nearby Independence who re-
fused to pay rent for eight months 
because of dangerous living con-
ditions. That strike, which KC 
Tenants helped organize, ended 
after tenants secured a new con-
tract that froze rent levels and 
prohibited the building from be-
ing sold without tenant approval.
Sitting on the couch she would 
later throw away because of 
mold, Barlow watched and re-
watched news clips about the 
nearby rent strike.
“It kind of inspired me,” she 
said.
She started talking to other 
residents about the building’s 
problems. At first, many were 
reluctant to confront the land-
lord and afraid of being evicted, 
she said.
Then the heat in the building 
went out. To warm his apartment, 
one of Barlow’s neighbors, who is 
partially blind, turned on his 
oven and left its door open. After 
that, Barlow said, “people started 
speaking out.”
Herbert Kelley, a Bowen Tower 
resident, was among them. “I had 
mold, mildew, water coming in 
from between the walls, soaking 
in the carpet,” Kelley said. When 
“a water pipe busted on the side 
of my kitchen and water ran all 
out the wall,” he did the repairs 
himself.
So when he heard about the 
tenants union, Kelley said he 
thought, “It’s worth a try.”
As enthusiasm mounted, Bar-
low contacted KC Tenants, which 
went door to door talking to 
residents about the building’s 
maintenance problems. A few 
months later, a majority of Bowen 
Tower residents voted to form a 
tenants union and secured a 
meeting with one of the build-
ing’s managers. Unsatisfied with 
the progress, they declared a rent 
strike.
Within weeks, some residents 
began receiving eviction notices 
— a swift reaction that had 
prompted other tenant groups in 
town to back down and worried 
veteran KC Tenants organizers.
At a mid-October rally in a 
Raytown parking lot, Bowen Tow-
er residents voted to stay the 
course. “Right now, I’m seeing 
everybody thumbs-up,” KC Ten-
ants organizer Justin Stein said. 
“Hell yeah.”
In early November, Yolanda 
Washington, 69, appeared at the 
county courthouse, packed with 
KC Tenants members wearing 
matching yellow T-shirts, to face 
trial for nonpayment of rent.
Washington, who has lived in 
the building for six years, owed 
$12,000 and should be evicted, 
lawyers representing building 
management told the judge.
She stopped paying rent be-
cause the property manager 
didn’t fix her leaking, moldy sink, 
Washington told the judge, and 
she had been feeling sick for 
months.
“I need my health to take care 
of me and my husband. … I’m 
almost 70, and he’s 74. We can’t do 
this,” she said on the steps of the 
courthouse after the trial.
A few weeks later, the judge 
ruled that the landlord had “vio-
lated the warranty of habitability 
by failing to address” mainte-
nance issues “in a timely man-
ner.” Washington’s apartment 
was worth only $500 a month, 
not the $1,058 the building had 
charged, according to the ruling, 
which ordered her to pay just 
$5,000 in back rent.
The building is now refusing to 
renew Washington’s lease. “I’m 
not going to get put out,” Wash-
ington said. “The Lord is not 
going to allow that to happen.”
A judge reduced a second Bow-
en Tower resident’s back rent in 
late December; five more tenants 
are awaiting rulings, with anoth-
er three scheduled to appear in 
court in January.
Barlow is scheduled for evic-
tion court in January, and Bowen 
Tower management hasn’t re-
newed her lease. She hopes to 
move to Virginia someday to be 
near the beach and her grandchil-
dren. But for now, “am I giving 
up?” Barlow said, sitting in her 
living room, where a piece of 
unfinished plywood covers a vent 
where drywall was removed to fix 
a leak. “Nope.”

the washington post . wednesday, december 31, 2025
BY SCOTT NOVER
Tatiana Schlossberg, a journal-
ist who told stories of the chang-
ing climate and the ways humans 
can help protect the environ-
ment, and whose terminal illness 
and position in the Kennedy fam-
ily thrust her into the national 
spotlight late in life, died Dec. 30. 
She was 35.
Her family announced the 
death in a social media post 
shared by the John F. Kennedy 
Library Foundation. The post did 
not say where she died.
Ms. Schlossberg published a 
New Yorker essay in November 
revealing that she had been diag-
nosed with a rare form of acute 
myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the 
blood and bone marrow. Between 
reflections on her family and 
mortality, she harshly criticized 
her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 
the secretary of health and hu-
man services, for his opposition 
to government-funded medical 
research and vaccines.
As an environmental journal-
ist, Ms. Schlossberg was drawn to 
stories that humanized sprawling 
and complicated policy issues — 
often while offering her a chance 
to participate in the action her-
self.
While chronicling the impact 
of climate change, she jumped in 
a cranberry bog in Massachu-
setts. She later spent nearly eight 
hours skiing the Birkebeiner, a 
cross-country race in Wisconsin 
threatened by warm weather and 
a lack of snow.
“On the lake, my cross-country 
skis began to skate in a rhythm, 
something that had eluded me for 
much of the day,” she wrote in a 
dispatch for Outside magazine. “I 
felt like I was flying.”
Ms. Schlossberg studied at Yale 
and Oxford before launching her 
journalism career at the Record 
newspaper in New Jersey, cover-
ing crime and local affairs. She 
joined the New York Times in 
2014 as an intern and was named 
a staff writer on the paper’s Metro 
desk before moving to the science 
section, where colleagues regard-
ed her as a curious, hardworking 
reporter who wore her privilege 
lightly.
A granddaughter of President 
John F. Kennedy and first lady 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ms. 
Schlossberg was the second child 
of Caroline Kennedy, a former 
U.S. ambassador to Australia and 
Japan, and Edwin Schlossberg, 
an artist and designer.
“She was a total delight,” said 
Henry Fountain, a longtime cli-
mate and science reporter at the 
Times. Ms. Schlossberg “just re-
searched her butt off on stories,” 
he added.
After leaving the Times in 2017, 
Ms. Schlossberg began freelanc-
ing and, in 2019, published “In-
conspicuous Consumption: The 
Environmental Impact You Don’t 
Know You Have.” The book exam-
ined the hidden costs of everyday 
activities — streaming videos, 
buying jeans, eating burgers — 
and was honored by the Society of 
Environmental Journalists.
“Using history, science and a 
personal narrative, Schlossberg 
provides a better understanding 
of both individual and systemic 
drivers of ecological destruction,” 
the judges said in awarding her 
the Rachel Carson book prize. 
“Readers will find solace, humor 
and a route to feeling empowered 
with possibilities for positive 
change, rather than drained by an 
accumulation of bad news.”
Ms. Schlossberg had been plan-
ning to write a second book, on 
the oceans, when she was found 
to have cancer in May 2024, while 
in the hospital for the birth of her 
second child.
In her New Yorker essay, she 
wrote of her shock at getting the 
diagnosis — “This could not pos-
sibly be my life” — and of the 
turbulent 18 months that fol-
lowed, in which she received stem 
cell donations from her sister as 
well as a stranger in the Pacific 
Northwest; underwent chemo-
therapy; and participated in a 
clinical trial, testing a new type of 
immunotherapy.
In recounting her experience, 
Ms. Schlossberg implicitly ac-
knowledged that her family, and 
her mother in particular, had 
dealt with years of grief. Her 
mother was only 5 when her 
father, President Kennedy, was 
assassinated in Dallas in 1963. 
She was 10 when the same fate 
befell her uncle, Robert F. Kenne-
dy, while he was campaigning for 
president in Los Angeles. Her 
younger brother, John Jr., died in 
a plane crash in 1999.
“For my whole life, I have tried 
to be good, to be a good student 
and a good sister and a good 
daughter, and to protect my 
mother and never make her upset 
or angry,” Ms. Schlossberg wrote. 
“Now I have added a new tragedy 
to her life, to our family’s life, and 
there’s nothing I can do to stop it.”
Ms. Schlossberg recalled that 
she was in her hospital bed when 
her cousin “Bobby, in the face of 
logic and common sense, was 
confirmed” as health and human 
services secretary, “despite never 
having worked in medicine, pub-
lic health, or the government.”
Kennedy had previously run 
for president as an independent, 
in what Ms. Schlossberg called 
“an embarrassment to me and the 
rest of my immediate family.” He 
faced blowback when he ac-
knowledged that he had placed a 
dead bear in Central Park a de-
cade earlier, a bizarre episode 
that — in an odd twist of fate — 
Ms. Schlossberg had reported on 
for the Times, writing in 2014 that 
state investigators concluded 
that the bear had died after being 
struck by a car but did not know 
how it ended up in the park.
“Like law enforcement, I had 
no idea who was responsible for 
this when I wrote the story,” Ms. 
Schlossberg told the Times last 
year.
In her New Yorker essay, Ms. 
Schlossberg wrote that her cous-
in’s 
health 
policy 
decisions 
threatened her own survival and 
that of “millions of cancer survi-
vors, small children, and the el-
derly.”
“I watched as Bobby cut nearly 
half a billion dollars for research 
into mRNA vaccines, technology 
that could be used against certain 
cancers; slashed billions in fund-
ing from the National Institutes 
of Health, the world’s largest 
sponsor of medical research; and 
threatened to oust the panel of 
medical experts charged with rec-
ommending preventive cancer 
screenings,” she wrote.
She also noted that the drug 
misoprostol, which she had re-
ceived to stop a postpartum hem-
orrhage that nearly killed her, 
was “part of medication abortion, 
which, at Bobby’s urging, is cur-
rently ‘under review’ by the Food 
and Drug Administration.”
“I freeze when I think about 
what would have happened if it 
had not been immediately avail-
able to me and to millions of other 
women who need it to save their 
lives or to get the care they de-
serve.”
‘I was not just a sick person’
Tatiana Celia Kennedy Schloss-
berg was born in Manhattan on 
May 5, 1990. She was raised on the 
Upper East Side with her older 
sister, artist and filmmaker Rose 
Schlossberg, and her younger 
brother, Jack Schlossberg, who is 
now running for Congress in New 
York.
Ms. Schlossberg studied histo-
ry at Yale University, where she 
received a bachelor’s degree in 
2012 and served as editor in chief 
of the weekly Yale Herald. She 
later earned a master’s in Ameri-
can history from the University of 
Oxford.
As a freelance journalist, Ms. 
Schlossberg contributed to publi-
cations including The Washing-
ton Post, the Atlantic and Vanity 
Fair. She wrote a weekly newslet-
ter, News From a Changing Plan-
et, until 2024.
Juliet Eilperin, The Post’s dep-
uty Futures editor, called her “one 
of the least pretentious journal-
ists I have ever dealt with.”
“Tatiana had an intense desire 
to be out in the field, immersing 
herself in nature and talking with 
scientists,” Eilperin said. “She was 
meticulous and exhaustive in her 
research, scrutinizing environ-
mental problems and what might 
be done to fix them.”
In 2017, Ms. Schlossberg mar-
ried George Moran at her family’s 
home on Martha’s Vineyard, in a 
ceremony officiated by former 
Massachusetts governor Deval 
Patrick. Moran, a urologist, was a 
resident at Columbia-Presbyteri-
an when Ms. Schlossberg was 
diagnosed with cancer at the hos-
pital.
“George did everything for me 
that he possibly could,” she wrote 
in her essay. “He talked to all the 
doctors and insurance people 
that I didn’t want to talk to; he 
slept on the floor of the hospital; 
he didn’t get mad when I was 
raging on steroids and yelled at 
him that I did not like Schweppes 
ginger ale, only Canada Dry.”
In addition to her husband, 
survivors include their two chil-
dren; her parents; and her broth-
er and sister.
While battling cancer, Ms. 
Schlossberg held her profession 
up as a point of pride. “My son 
knows that I am a writer and that 
I write about our planet,” she 
wrote. “Since I’ve been sick, I 
remind him a lot, so that he will 
know that I was not just a sick 
person.”

Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman (D) addresses the chamber after her reelection on Jan. 3, 2023. Hortman was killed June 14. 
sam hodde/For the Washington Post
Turning Point USA founder and conservative activist Charlie Kirk 
onstage in Grapevine, Texas, in June. Kirk was killed Sept. 10.
BY ANNA LISS-ROY
To Julia Coleman, Minnesota 
House Speaker Melissa Hortman 
and Turning Point USA founder 
Charlie Kirk were just “Melissa” 
and “Charlie.”
Coleman, a Republican state 
senator, knew Hortman, a Demo-
crat, through their work in the 
Minnesota legislature. The two 
had discussed reopening the Cap-
itol day care center, while sitting 
in Hortman’s office sharing tequi-
la and Milano cookies. Coleman 
was Turning Point USA’s first 
Minnesota employee, and Kirk, 
her first boss, became her friend.
On June 14, Melissa was shot 
dead.
On Sept. 10, so was Charlie.
Coleman, 34, watched in hor-
ror as her social media feeds be-
came clouded with a thickening 
haze of baseless and speculative 
ideas about her former col-
leagues’ deaths.
“When I see people spreading 
horrible conspiracy theories that 
are completely based out of noth-
ing and dishonor the person who 
passed away, I feel compelled to 
say something,” Coleman said. 
“More elected officials have to 
stop sitting on their hands and 
start calling it out.”
That is what she is trying to do.
On the Sunday after Christmas, 
Coleman stood in her kitchen, 
making dinner for her family, 
when she saw a post that infuriat-
ed her. The user claimed Hort-
man’s assassination was connect-
ed to a fraud scandal in Minneso-
ta, and they implied Hortman 
knew her life was in danger. 
(There is no evidence supporting 
either of these claims.)
“This is sick,” Coleman thought 
to herself. She began to type.
“I am a Minnesota Republican 
legislator. I never agreed with 
Melissa. Not once. But I’m beg-
ging people to stop sharing this 
conspiracy 
theory,” 
Coleman 
wrote. “Please, unless you have 
evidence, stop trying to get social 
media clout off the death of a good 
person that you know nothing 
about.”
Within 24 hours, her post at-
tracted more than a million views.
Responses have been mostly 
positive, she said. Coleman sees 
conspiracies and misinformation 
trending more on her own side, 
the political right, but believes the 
problem transcends partisan loy-
alties. In Minnesota, traumatized 
legislators have stayed away from 
Hortman and Kirk conspiracy 
theories, and many have been 
speaking out against them, Cole-
man said.
Hours after her first post, Cole-
man followed up: “I’ve learned 
two things today 1) invest in tin-
foil (for hats on both sides of the 
aisle) 2) buy a bunch of jumbo 
crayons and construction paper 
for explaining basic concepts to 
people this upcoming year.” Oth-
ers, including former Minnesota 
Senate majority leader Paul Ga-
zelka, a Republican, have also 
come out to slam the rumors.
Legislators have watched as 
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) has 
borne the brunt of recent attacks, 
with some people claiming base-
lessly that Walz was involved with 
Hortman’s assassination.
The conspiracists have relied 
on a video of Hortman in tears 
after she voted to end a budget 
deadlock by supporting a spend-
ing plan that cut health benefits 
for people who are in the country 
illegally. Coleman has said that 
Hortman was upset because she 
knew people would lose health 
care, and that there is no evidence 
of any link between the shooting 
and the scandal, which involves 
allegations of improper social ser-
vices payments to dozens of So-
mali immigrants.
Kirk conspiracies are tied to 
unproven claims that the political 
activist’s killing was related to his 
stance on Israel.
Coleman saw the governor at a 
bill signing shortly after Hortman 
was killed. Walz had lost weight. 
She noticed pain in his eyes. “It’s 
got to be hard that people are 
sitting there thinking he did that 
or would order that to be done 
just because a crazy man said it to 
be true,” Coleman said.
A spokesperson for Walz did 
not respond to a request for com-
ment.
After Hortman and Kirk were 
killed, Coleman had panic at-
tacks. She questioned whether 
she should quit her job to protect 
her three young boys. “It was a 
rough summer and fall. Losing 
two people to assassinations — I 
just never thought that sentence 
would even come out of my 
mouth,” Coleman said. “The ini-
tial reaction was: I have to get out 
of this if I want my kids to grow up 
with a mother.”
Then, Coleman thought about 
who would be left to speak up if 
people like her were intimidated 
out of politics. She said she decid-
ed she did not want to let fear 
drive her from public office — but 
knows the experience will never 
be the same.
“It feels like all the magic that 
was in this job got sucked out of it 
on June 14,” Coleman said. “Long-
standing grudges have been 
erased because a lot of us just are 
in the trenches now together.”
When legislators walk into the 
House chamber, they see Hort-
man’s photo and roses on her 
desk.
When the doorbell rings at 
home, they now check their secu-
rity camera before answering.
“I’ve seen some people start to 
speak up, and I hope that my 
actions [Sunday], which came 
from a moment of frustration 
standing in my kitchen, will en-
courage others to do the same,” 
Coleman said.

cies. Some including lead poison-
ing specialists and lab scientists 
were rehired, but many adminis-
trative support staff, communica-
tions and program officers are 
among those who remain laid off.
As secretary, Kennedy brought 
in fierce critics of the public 
health covid response and federal 
health agencies more broadly. 
Bigtree told The Post that candi-
dates for top health roles were 
questioned to see whether they 
agreed with some of Kennedy’s 
longtime vaccine safety priorities.
Under Kennedy, prominent fig-
ures in the anti-vaccine move-
ment have been working within 
the department on vaccine safety 
issues, including Lyn redwood, a 
former leader of the anti-vaccine 
group Kennedy founded, Chil-
dren’s Health Defense, and David 
Geier and mark Blaxill, two long-
time proponents of false claims 
that vaccines can cause autism. 
The three did not return requests 
for comment.
In a statement, White House 
spokesman Kush Desai said Ken-
nedy and his team at HHS are 
restoring “Gold Standard Science 
and accountability to our public 
health bodies” after the medical 
establishment pushed “unscien-
tific lockdowns and mask man-
dates” during the coronavirus 
pandemic.
Kennedy has accused public 
health agencies of being dishon-
est during the pandemic. He re-
peated that criticism, arguing the 
government 
overreached 
on 
covid vaccines, when a reporter 
asked how to avoid the violence 
the CDC witnessed in August, 
when a gunman incensed by coro-
navirus vaccines attacked the 
agency’s Atlanta campus.
Public health and medical ex-
perts say the turnover in staff and 
leadership has hollowed out the 
federal government’s scientific 
capacity to anticipate and re-
spond to health threats.
“for people who are still left at 
the [CDC], there is chaos and 
confusion, and morale is at an 
all-time low,” Aryn melton Backus 
said at a November rally in sup-
port of public health. She was a 
health communication specialist 
placed on administrative leave as 
part of pending layoffs from the 
CDC’s office on Smoking and 
Health, which has funded state 
tobacco control programs.
The reduction of CDC staff and 
programs is being felt across the 
country. In Georgia, where smok-
ing is the leading cause of pre-
ventable death, state officials cut 
a tobacco control and prevention 
program. An online concussion 
training that many school youth 
sports coaches must complete 
will no longer be updated with the 
latest research. Local officials 
who want to fluoridate their 
drinking water to improve oral 
health no longer have access to 
technical experts who can help 
calibrate the proper levels.
As Kennedy upended the pub-
lic health workforce, he leaned 
into his more broadly popular 
messaging around overhauling 
the food industry. He has posted 
on social media more than twice 
as frequently about food than vac-
cines while in office, according to 
The Post’s analysis of his personal 
President JD Vance stepped in to 
help negotiate his eventual sup-
port, according to two people fa-
miliar with the matter.
In a speech on the Senate floor, 
Cassidy detailed the commit-
ments he received from Kennedy 
in exchange for his vote, including 
to protect the nation’s vaccine 
infrastructure. All but one repub-
lican voted yes: Sen. mitch mcCo-
nnell of Kentucky, a childhood 
polio survivor who said he would 
“not condone the re-litigation of 
proven cures.” A week later, mc-
Connell announced he would not 
seek reelection.
Cassidy’s doubts proved pre-
scient. Within months, Kennedy 
found ways to bypass some of his 
pledges.
A fierce critic becomes the 
boss
Kennedy has called for the 
ouster of what he describes as 
“corrupt, industry-captured” fed-
eral health officials, arguing the 
health department had failed to 
keep Americans healthy.
“I’m not scared to disrupt 
things,” Kennedy said at a recent 
event at George Washington Uni-
versity.
Since february, health agen-
cies have been inundated by con-
tinuous waves of departures of 
more than 30 high-ranking senior 
career leaders — representing de-
cades of experience on managing 
infectious-disease outbreaks, ad-
ministering billions in research 
dollars and overseeing the na-
tion’s drug supply, according to a 
Post review.
Thousands more staffers were 
laid off in what some called the 
“April fools’ Day massacre,” a 
sweeping purge and proposed re-
organization of the health agen-
messaging pushing for healthier, 
less-processed foods proved far 
more popular than his views on 
immunization.
Kennedy’s confirmation large-
ly hinged on Sen. Bill Cassidy 
(r-Louisiana), a physician and 
chair of the Senate health com-
mittee who begged Kennedy to 
disavow his false claims linking 
vaccines and autism and raised 
concerns about Kennedy’s in-
volvement in vaccine safety litiga-
tion.
“[Does a] 71-year-old man who 
has spent decades criticizing vac-
cines and who’s financially vested 
in finding fault with vaccines, can 
he change his attitudes and ap-
proach now that he’ll have the 
most important position influ-
encing vaccine policy in the Unit-
ed States?” Cassidy asked during 
Kennedy’s confirmation hearing.
As Cassidy vacillated, Vice 
and anti-vaccine advocacy, and 
newer people in Kennedy’s orbit, 
such as Calley means, a health 
entrepreneur.
one night, several of those at 
the beach house bonded over lis-
tening to the Grateful Dead, ac-
cording to michael Caputo, who 
was Trump’s HHS spokesman in 
2020. They viewed the best-sell-
ing book “Good Energy” written 
by now-surgeon general nominee 
Casey means along with her 
brother Calley, that promotes 
healthy eating and exercise to 
optimize metabolic health — as 
mAHA’s bible, he said.
“food expanded the movement 
overnight,” Bigtree, who was Ken-
nedy’s communications director 
during his presidential campaign, 
said in an interview. “It was an 
easier topic to sell to moms across 
America.”
on Capitol Hill, Kennedy’s 
viewed as one of the campaign’s 
top surrogates, bringing along 
some voters who might not have 
backed Trump. Before winning 
the presidency, Trump promised 
to let Kennedy “go wild on 
health.”
Although some Trump aides 
had weighed making Kennedy, a 
lawyer, a White House health czar, 
Kennedy told Trump he wanted to 
be considered as HHS Secretary, 
according to three people familiar 
with the matter. Donald Trump Jr. 
and Charlie Kirk, a conservative 
activist who was fatally shot this 
year, advised Kennedy that he 
needed to be in charge of an 
actual bureaucracy to make last-
ing change and avoid being side-
lined, one person said. Trump Jr. 
and Turning Point USA, Kirk’s 
organization, did not respond to 
requests for comment.
Just over a week after Election 
Day, Trump tapped Kennedy to 
helm the nation’s sprawling 
health department, an almost $2 
trillion portfolio responsible for 
administering health insurance, 
approving drugs and medical de-
vices and responding to infec-
tious-disease outbreaks.
The luxury florida beach 
house of mehmet oz — a physi-
cian and the former daytime tele-
vision star who is now the nation’s 
medicare and medicaid chief — 
quickly became ground zero for 
pushing mAHA’s agenda and se-
curing Kennedy’s position in 
Washington, according to multi-
ple attendees. Those weeks forged 
an alliance among some who 
challenged the medical establish-
ment, including Del Bigtree, head 
of the anti-vaccine group In-
formed Consent Action Network 
(ICAN), and Spear, a longtime ally 
to Kennedy in his environmental 
tion.”
“This was a newly reconstitut-
ed committee, and the secretary 
was providing a North Star to 
make sure suggestions were com-
municated to the members for 
consideration,” Nixon said.
over the course of the year, 
Kennedy’s actions have alarmed 
public health experts, medical as-
sociations and current and for-
mer health officials, who say he is 
eroding trust in science and dis-
mantling confidence in long-
standing public health measures.
“I do feel shocked by how 
quickly he has been able to imple-
ment these things that he has 
clearly been pretty passionate 
about for many years,” said Kerry 
Kennedy 
meltzer, 
Kennedy’s 
niece and a physician who this 
year released email exchanges 
with her uncle in an attempt to 
foil his Senate confirmation to 
lead HHS.
Kennedy has challenged years 
of public health messaging on 
vaccines, including instructing 
the CDC to contradict the long-
settled scientific conclusion that 
vaccines do not cause autism. His 
once-fringe views have moved to 
the center of the nation’s health 
strategy amid a growing distrust 
in the medical establishment af-
ter the coronavirus pandemic.
“It is now acceptable to talk 
about all these issues,” said Leslie 
manookian, a leader in the “medi-
cal freedom” movement, which 
opposes vaccine mandates. “The 
person that we have most to 
thank for that is Bobby Kennedy, 
together with President Trump.”
Kennedy has maintained the 
backing of the White House and a 
warm relationship with President 
Donald Trump, whom he speaks 
to often, as the two aligned on 
their make America Healthy 
Again initiative to encourage bet-
ter nutrition and address chronic 
disease and childhood illness, ac-
cording to two people familiar 
with the matter.
Besides his heavy focus on im-
munizations, Kennedy has also 
taken on the food industry. Next 
year will test, ahead of the mid-
terms, whether he can deliver 
sweeping change on this more 
broadly popular agenda.
This account of Kennedy’s as-
cent and leadership since becom-
ing HHS secretary is based on 
interviews with almost 100 cur-
rent and former federal health 
officials, Kennedy allies, public 
health experts and others. many 
spoke on the condition of ano-
nymity to detail private conversa-
tions, internal deliberations or 
out of fear of retaliation.
In response to an interview 
request, Kennedy said in a text 
message: “Wapo has been more 
consistently unfair, biased, and 
inaccurate, and it’s reporting 
about me than any other major 
outlet. Im not inclined to validate 
that bias with an interview.”
He referred the request to Ste-
fanie Spear, a top aide, who said 
Kennedy wanted to share a Sub-
stack article with a Post reporter 
that described the “invisibility of 
vaccine injury,” adding Kennedy 
could perhaps do an interview 
after the first of the year.
The HHS media relations office 
did not answer detailed questions 
for this article, but did comment 
on the email from Anderson and 
identified what Kennedy has 
done so far in a statement.
“Under Secretary Kennedy’s 
leadership, HHS is exercising its 
full authority to deliver results for 
the American people,” Nixon said.
“In 2025, the Department 
confronted long-standing pub-
lic health challenges with trans-
parency, courage, and gold-stan-
dard science — eliminating pe-
troleum-based food dyes from 
the nation’s food supply, remov-
ing the black box warning for

reform, streamlining prior au-
thorization, investing in rural 
health, accelerating biosimilars, 
doubling funding for childhood 
cancer research, launching an 
agency-wide AI strategy, and in-
creasing transparency in drug 
advertising,” 
Nixon 
added. 
“HHS will carry this momentum 
into 2026 to strengthen ac-
countability, put patients first, 
and protect public health.”
RFK Jr.’s rise to power
In August 2024, Kennedy 
strode onto a stage in Arizona to 
suspend his long-shot indepen-
dent presidential bid. flanked by 
American flags, he explained why 
the scion of a famous Democratic 
family was endorsing a republi-
can, Trump.
“I asked myself what choices 
must I make to maximize my 
chances to save America’s chil-
dren and restore national health,” 
Kennedy said.

lenges to school vaccine man-
dates and petitioned the govern-
ment to reconsider its approval of 
Sanofi’s stand-alone polio vac-
cine.
But the plan to invite Siri fell 
apart after objections from career 
CDC staff and legal advisers who 
raised concerns about providing a 
platform to a man who has repeat-
edly sued the agency seeking data 
about vaccine safety on behalf of 
ICAN, the anti-vaccine group. 
Kennedy was informed of those 
concerns, one of the officials said.
After almost six months and an 
exodus of CDC leaders, Siri was 
invited to the agency’s headquar-
ters for the December meeting of 
the vaccine advisers and spent 
more than 90 minutes arguing 
that the history of childhood im-
munization in the U.S. is marred 
by insufficient research and im-
properly performed vaccine clini-
cal trials. HHS did not answer 
questions from The Post about 
Siri’s appearance.
Siri said he has a “significant 
knowledge base” about vaccines 
based on his legal work, including 
regularly suing health authorities 
and deposing and cross-examin-
ing leading vaccinologists. “If you 
were standing in my office with 
me right now, you would be look-
ing at a bookshelf that is filled 
with medical textbooks on vacci-
nology, immunology, infectious-
disease and pediatrics,” he said.
Cassidy, the Republican sena-
tor, reacted with shock to Siri’s 
appearance at ACIP.
It was his latest frustration 
with the health department’s 
handling of vaccine issues under 
Kennedy, including the revisions 
to the CDC website language on 
autism. The page includes an as-
terisk after the header “Vaccines 
do not cause Autism,” explaining 
that the header was not removed 
as part of an agreement with 
Cassidy. But the revised webpage 
also claims the assertion that vac-
cines do not cause autism is not 
evidence based and that health 
authorities ignored studies sup-
porting a link.
Cassidy’s office declined re-
peated requests for a formal 
 interview. Approached at the Cap-
itol and asked about Kennedy’s 
vaccine commitments, Cassidy 
said, “You can compare those ac-
tions to those commitments I 
enumerated in my floor speech, 
and I’ll let you draw your own 
conclusions.”
But what were his conclusions? 
“I’ll leave it at that,” he said.
The looming fight
Kennedy has spent much of 
this year laying the groundwork 
for bigger changes to the nation’s 
vaccine and food policy.
Investigations Kennedy com-
missioned into the causes of au-
tism, safety of vaccines and 
whether fluoridated water harms 
children are expected to release 
findings.
The Trump administration is 
weighing plans to shift the federal 
government away from directly 
recommending most vaccines for 
children and to more closely align 
with Denmark’s immunization 
model of suggesting fewer shots, 
according to two people familiar 
with the matter.
Kennedy plans to release re-
vised federal dietary guidelines 
for healthy eating habits early 
next year, which will be partly tied 
to when Americans are making 
New Year’s resolutions, according 
to a federal health official. Kenne-
dy has said the guidelines will 
focus on eating whole foods.
The health department is also 
hoping to finalize a plan as soon 
as next year to require labels on 
the front of food and drink pack-
ages to alert Americans about 
unhealthy foods. Under Kennedy, 
health officials are working inter-
nally to determine the best ap-
proach to the labels first proposed 
in the Biden administration, ac-
cording to two people familiar 
with the matter.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has criss-
crossed the country to support 
governors who have restricted us-
ing food stamps to buy soda and 
candy and have signed bills to 
remove artificial dyes from school 
meals. Some MAHA proponents 
want to see another wave of poli-
cies next year that would promote 
nutrition education and also chal-
lenge long-standing public health 
practices such as vaccine man-
dates. The nonprofit advocacy 
group MAHA Action has met with 
almost 20 top state officials as it 
pushes for states to embrace the 
movement.
“Bobby Kennedy is doing the 
work he was put on the planet to 
do,” said Tony Lyons, president of 
MAHA Action.
Kennedy’s allies say he’s just 
getting started. They hope he’ll be 
secretary for eight years.

sory panel,” according to a tran-
script of the exchange captured by 
videoconferencing software and 
reviewed by The Post. He later 
told The Post he was referring to 
pressure from outside groups 
critical of changes to vaccine rec-
ommendations, not the adminis-
tration.
‘Raise the risk, bury the 
benefits’
Kennedy and his aides have 
repeatedly said the Trump admin-
istration is not limiting access to 
vaccines for those who want 
them, but is instead working to 
help people make informed deci-
sions. Critics say they are exagger-
ating the downsides and obfus-
cating the value of immunization.
“The secretary and his commit-
tee have stopped doing the hard 
job of balancing the risks and 
benefits of vaccines,” said Dan 
Jernigan, who oversaw the CDC’s 
vaccine safety office. He described 
their playbook as “raise the risk, 
bury the benefits, sow confusion, 
drive down use.”
In the late summer, Jernigan 
and two other high-ranking offi-
cials resigned in protest over 
what they called an unscientific 
and politicized approach to vac-
cines.
In one instance that alarmed 
career staff, Kennedy wanted Aar-
on Siri, a top lawyer for the anti-
vaccine movement, and perhaps 
Paul Offit, a scientist who is a 
prominent proponent of vaccines 
and critic of Kennedy, to speak 
publicly during the June meeting 
of the new vaccine advisers, ac-
cording to three former health 
officials familiar with a meeting 
where a CDC senior adviser re-
layed the secretary’s request. Siri 
has been involved in legal chal-
suggestions were not directives.
Joseph Hibbeln, a neuroscien-
tist who has become a dissenting 
voice on the vaccine panel, said 
committee members have not 
been given clear answers when 
they have asked who is determin-
ing which vaccines they are scru-
tinizing.
Robert Malone, a prominent 
critic of coronavirus vaccines who 
is now the panel’s vice chair, said 
he did not know how the agenda 
items were developed but that 
there would be nothing “nefari-
ous” about Kennedy or other top 
Trump administration officials 
“contributing” to agenda items 
because the panel’s job is to pro-
vide advice.
During the panel’s December 
meeting, Kirk Milhoan, chairman 
of the vaccine committee, was 
overheard telling another mem-
ber that he felt “a little bit like 
puppets on a string as opposed to 
really being an independent advi-
al.
“The secretary is within his 
legal rights to make these sugges-
tions or requests, but it’s unheard 
of as far as I know,” said Romero, 
who was a top health official in 
Arkansas during the pandemic 
and then at the CDC. He now 
consults for the pharmaceutical 
industry on vaccines and is a 
member of the American Acade-
my of Pediatrics infectious diseas-
es committee.
An HHS official, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity be-
cause of legal concerns, said the 
career CDC official who oversees 
ACIP sets its agenda and that 
members of the committee are 
ultimately responsible for writing 
the questions they vote on.
In reference to the May email, 
the official said HHS officials 
worked with the CDC’s adminis-
trative officer for the vaccine pan-
el to communicate the sugges-
tions to the members, but those 
makes 
vaccine 
recommenda-
tions, setting in motion plans to 
remake the vaccine system. Ken-
nedy argued the panel had be-
come “little more than a rubber 
stamp for any vaccine” with mem-
bers too closely tied to the phar-
maceutical industry. He selected 
new members, some of whom had 
histories of criticizing vaccine 
guidance. The former CDC direc-
tor, Susan Monarez, said she was 
fired in August for refusing to be a 
“rubber-stamp” to the new com-
mittee.
The panel has voted on some of 
Kennedy’s requests detailed in 
the May email from Anderson, 
who is no longer with HHS and 
did not respond to requests for 
comment.
The vaccine panel voted in 
June to remove thimerosal — 
which the CDC had concluded is 
safe but Kennedy and his allies 
have decried as unnecessarily ex-
posing children to mercury — 
from the rare multidose flu shot 
vials that contain it. In that same 
meeting, they vowed to form a 
work group to look at vaccines 
that have not been subject to 
review in more than seven years, 
in line with Kennedy’s request.
The panel over several months 
grappled with how to revise the 
guidance for all newborns to re-
ceive a hepatitis B vaccine. It 
ultimately voted in December to 
stop recommending the shot 
when the mother tests negative 
and to instead encourage those 
parents to consult doctors about 
whether and when to begin vacci-
nation.
José Romero, who began serv-
ing on ACIP in 2014 and chaired 
the panel from 2018 to mid-2021, 
described Kennedy’s asks to the 
committee as “extremely” unusu-
accounts and official HHS ac-
counts. Last summer, almost 1 in 3 
social media posts focused on 
food.
He often highlights posts about 
companies pledging to remove 
artificial dyes from food products, 
which has been one of his signa-
ture efforts.
Some in the food sector have 
been trying to accommodate Ken-
nedy and downplay differences 
with his initiatives, in hopes of 
avoiding MAHA criticism, ac-
cording to two people involved in 
the industry. That’s a stark shift 
for an industry accustomed to 
viewing the GOP as an ally.
“Wanting to eat simpler foods, 
more real foods, look at the ingre-
dients, all of that is not a Demo-
crat hippie thing anymore,” said 
Vani Hari, an author, activist and 
Kennedy ally who also writes un-
der the name of the Food Babe. 
“It’s a Republican thing too now.”
Kennedy returns to his core 
issue: Vaccines
As Kennedy sought senators’ 
support to become health secre-
tary, he told them he supported 
the 
childhood 
immunization 
schedule, including the shot for 
measles, which he had previously 
falsely described as increasing the 
odds of spreading the virus.
In the past, Kennedy had de-
cried the “exploding vaccine 
schedule,” claiming that the series 
of vaccines recommended to chil-
dren is linked to the rise of au-
tism, chronic disease and food 
allergies. Medical experts have 
argued these purported links 
have no basis in evidence and that 
the increase in vaccinations has 
successfully combated more dis-
ease. He wrote a book in 2014 
calling for removal of the mercu-
ry-based preservative thimerosal 
from vaccines. He questioned 
why newborns should get the 
hepatitis B vaccine, which health 
authorities say is safe, claiming 
on an online show that it “poi-
soned” kids.
Kennedy faced his first big test 
on vaccines soon into his tenure. 
A measles surge had started in an 
under-vaccinated region of Texas, 
driving the country’s largest an-
nual case tally in at least 33 years 
and threatening to end the na-
tion’s measles elimination status.
At first, Kennedy downplayed 
the severity of the outbreak and 
later, under pressure, acknowl-
edged vaccines prevent the virus’s 
spread. But he muddled that mes-
sage by also falsely claiming the 
vaccines were not safety tested 
and contained aborted fetal de-
bris — a stark contrast from the 
first Trump administration’s un-
equivocal support for vaccination 
during a 2019 outbreak.
He repeatedly offered to send 
Texas vitamin A doses, an unprov-
en measles treatment in the U.S. 
embraced by vaccine skeptics as 
an alternative to immunization, 
even though the vitamin is pri-
marily used for malnourished 
children abroad and public 
health workers and doctors said 
their focus was vaccination, ac-
cording to a top state health offi-
cial, Jennifer Shuford.
In June, he fired every member 
of the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices, which

prompting opposition from the 
National Trust for Historic Pres-
ervation and the D.C. Preserva-
tion League, which are seeking to 
participate in a detailed on-site 
assessment of the structures, nine 
of which they say were built in the 
late 1800s.
In a letter sent Sunday to the 
GSA, the preservation organiza-
tions raise “strong objections” to 
the proposed demolition, con-
tending that no evidence of an 
emergency exists beyond “Secre-
tary Noem’s unilateral declara-
tion” of one.
“A unilateral declaration like 
this is problematic because it 
bypasses the procedural safe-
guards designed to ensure stabili-
ty, legitimacy and fairness,” reads 
the letter signed by Elizabeth 
merritt, the National Trust’s dep-
uty general counsel, and rebecca 
miller, the Preservation League’s 
executive director.
regarding the purported secu-
rity risks, the preservationists 
wrote that the Homeland Securi-
ty campus possesses “the highest 
security classification for a gov-
ernment facility.” Concerns about 
threats, they wrote, “imply a fun-
damental flaw in the facility’s 
security as a whole,” not the va-
cant buildings.
The concerns about St. Eliza-
beths echo those raised after 
President Donald Trump ordered 
the demolition of the East Wing 
of the White House in october to 
make way for a ballroom. The 
National Trust earlier this month 
filed a lawsuit intended to require 
the White House to submit plans 
for a public review before con-
structing the 90,000-square-foot 
ballroom.
Under the terms of the redevel-
opment of the St. Elizabeths West 
Campus, the federal government 
is required to provide preserva-
tionists three business days to 
respond to an emergency notifi-
cation regarding the property, ac-
cording to the preservationists.
The GSA notified the adminis-
tration of D.C. mayor muriel E. 
Bowser (D) of the plan on the 
evening of Dec. 23. The GSA’s 
emailed letter to the city included 
Noem’s memo, as well as a safety 
assessment report completed 
Dec. 19.
Because of the federal holiday, 
the deadline is Dec. 31 for the 
city’s office of Historic Preserva-
tion and the Advisory Council on 
Historic Preservation to offer 
DEMOLITION From A1
comments, according to the pres-
ervation organizations.
David maloney, D.C.’s state his-
toric preservation officer, did not 
respond to a request for com-
ment. Nor did a spokesperson for 
Homeland Security.
marianne Copenhaver, a GSA 
spokesperson, said in an emailed 
statement that Homeland Securi-
ty alerted her agency about “a 
present security risk to life and 
property” at St. Elizabeths “that 
may require us to demolish build-
ings.”
“Accordingly, we are following 
all applicable laws and regula-
tions to address those issues,” she 
said.
Established by Congress in 
1855, St. Elizabeths was originally 
known as the Government Hospi-
tal for the Insane, according to 
the GSA’s website. The complex 
has been listed on the National 
register of Historic Places since 
1979. The federal government 
certified it as a National Historic 
Landmark in 1990.
The Department of Health and 
Human Services classified the 
West Campus as “excess proper-
ty” in 2001, after which the GSA 
took it over and led an effort to 
redevelop the property for Home-
land Security. A master plan for 
the site conceived of a project that 
would answer Homeland Securi-
ty’s need for more than 4 million 
square feet of office space and 
enough parking for 14,000 em-
ployees, according to the GSA 
website.
Because of the property’s land-
mark status, a protocol was estab-
lished to respond to any proposed 
demolition of the buildings. Four 
of the 17 buildings that Homeland 
Security is seeking to raze already 
have been approved for demoli-
tion by the National Capital Plan-
ning Commission and the Com-
mission of Fine Arts, miller said.
The proposed razing of the 13 
other buildings has not been re-
viewed, she said. Those buildings 
include 
Burroughs 
Cottage, 
which a wealthy couple built in 
1891 to house their daughter and 
her nursing staff. After the pa-
tient’s death in 1917, the family 
donated the cottage to St. Eliza-
beths, according to a report the 
Preservation League submitted 
to the city in 2005, when it was 
seeking a local landmark designa-
tion for the campus.
In the security assessment re-
port, Homeland Security officials 
assert that the vacant buildings 
could be “exploited by malicious 
insiders who possess legitimate 
access, familiarity with the cam-
pus, or detailed knowledge of 
security procedures.” The report 
describes these insiders as em-
ployees, contractors, or others 
who use their access and position 
“to plan, stage, or execute harm-
ful activities.”
“For senior leadership,” the re-
port asserts, “the principal risks 
include targeting of executives, 
disruption of essential operations 
and compromise of sensitive in-
formation or infrastructure.”
In their letter to the GSA, the 
preservationists contend that the 
buildings slated for razing have 
been vacant for many years and 
that the federal government has 
“not 
provided 
evidence 
of 
changed 
circumstances 
that 
would warrant ‘emergency’ de-
molition.”
“If the space within these va-
cant buildings is accessible,” they 
wrote, it’s the GSA and Homeland 
Security that have “failed to effec-
tively secure them.”

through Christ. He takes care of 
it all.”
mr. Smallwood was 33 when 
he signed his first record deal, 
with Benson records and its 
Christian music subsidiary onyx. 
His debut album, 1982’s “The 
richard Smallwood Singers,” 
spent 87 weeks on the Billboard 
gospel chart, while his follow-up, 
“Psalms,” brought him his first of 
eight Grammy nominations.
over the decades, mr. Small-
wood won top honors in gospel 
music, including several Dove 
and Stellar Awards. He per-
formed for three presidents — 
richard m. Nixon, ronald rea-
gan and Bill Clinton — and 
became the rare gospel artist to 
tour the Soviet Union. In 2006, 
he was inducted into the Gospel 
music Hall of Fame.
mr. Smallwood’s smooth, as-
sured voice anchored many 
songs that took on lives of their 
own, while his abilities behind 
the piano were steeped in his 
classical training at Howard Uni-
versity.
“No matter what genre he’s 
playing, in his music the piano is 
the prominent feature,” Jacquie 
Gales Webb, a longtime gospel 
radio host at WHUr, once said. 
“That’s how you know it’s a 
richard Smallwood song.”
While his music was often 
triumphant, mr. Smallwood pri-
vately battled depression, and 
drew on his personal sorrows to 
write one of his biggest hits. 
“Total Praise,” released in 1996 
with his gospel group Vision, was 
inspired by his experience caring 
for his mother, who had demen-
tia, and for a family friend who 
had cancer. mr. Smallwood said 
he had decided “to write a pity-
party song,” but found himself 
praising God instead, crafting 
lyrics that reasserted his faith in 
a moment of despair.
“In gospel, with this focus on 
celebration and praise, there can 
be an emotional narrowness to 
what people get to sing about,” 
said musicologist Braxton Shel-
ley, author of “Healing for the 
Soul: richard Smallwood, the 
Vamp, and the Gospel Imagina-
tion,” in an interview for this 
obituary. “But Smallwood’s pen 
has room for pain and hurt and

sorrow and anguish and melan-
choly.”
With its undercurrent of reli-
gious conviction, “Total Praise” 
has appeared in unexpected set-
tings. When Destiny’s Child were 
arranging a gospel medley to 
conclude their 2001 album “Sur-
vivor,” singer michelle Williams 
suggested ending the album with 
a snippet from the song, in which 
a triumphant choir builds on the 
word “Amen.” After the Sandy 
Hook Elementary School shoot-
ing in 2012, the family of one of 
the victims asked for the song to 
be performed at her funeral. 
“Total Praise” has even tran-
scended religious barriers, with a 
New Jersey choir translating the 
song into Hebrew for a Jewish 
choral festival.
“Smallwood speaks of ‘moun-
taintop praise’ — celebrating 
God when all is well — and 
‘valley praise,’ thanking God in 
the bleakest moments of life,” 
wrote Doug Peck, a conductor 
and teacher, in a 2021 tribute for 
the New York Times. With “Total 
Praise,” he said, mr. Smallwood 
“brought strength to millions of 
listeners,” especially in the song’s 
“Amen” section — “a musical and 
spiritual achievement on par 
with anything Bach left us.”
A family legacy of music and 
faith
richard Lee Smallwood was 
born in Atlanta on Nov. 30, 1948. 
He was raised by his mother, 
mabel, who worked odd jobs, 
and by his stepfather, Chester, a 
pastor who established Union 
Temple Baptist Church in Wash-
ington, where the family settled 
when mr. Smallwood was 10.
In his 2019 autobiography, 
“Total Praise,” mr. Smallwood 
recalled that he was a mediocre 
student and said that he was 
regularly beaten by his stepfa-
ther. But he found a creative 
outlet through music, soaking up 
motown records, Barbra Stre-
isand hits and musical theater 
standards from rodgers and 
Hammerstein.
mr. Smallwood formed his 
first gospel group at age 11, 
singing with kids from the neigh-
borhood. As an eighth-grader at 
Browne Junior High, he studied 
under a future giant of popular 
music, roberta Flack. As a teen-
ager, he was admitted to a precol-
lege training program at Howard 
that offered him a classical 
grounding in piano.
“Bach soon took a hold of me,” 
mr. Smallwood wrote in his auto-
biography, adding that the “mas-
ter of counterpoint and thematic 
improvisation became and still is 
my absolute favorite composer.”
At Howard, mr. Smallwood 
studied alongside music stu-
dents including soul singer Don-
ny Hathaway and helped form 
the university’s gospel choir. He 
received a bachelor’s degree in 
1971 and returned to get a mas-
ter’s in musicology and piano.
By the end of the 1970s, mr. 
Smallwood was touring with the 
richard Smallwood Singers, who 
featured some of the vocalists he 
led in the young adult choir at 
Union Temple Baptist Church. 
He started a successor group, 
Vision, in 1995.
mr. Smallwood, who never 
married, came to describe the 
ensemble as his family. He is 
survived by two brothers and 
three foster sisters.
In his autobiography, mr. 
Smallwood wrote of his years-
long struggle with depression, 
including a period in the late 
1990s when he struggled to get 
out of bed and regularly thought 
of suicide.
A turning point came in 2010, 
when he had a dream about his 
late stepfather. They were walk-
ing down a street together and 
stopped to listen to music. When 
mr. Smallwood woke up, he 
broke down in tears. The dream 
alleviated the pain of his rela-
tionship with his stepfather, he 
said, and cured him of his de-
pression.
“It was God’s way of healing 
me of some of the things I was 
dealing with,” mr. Smallwood 
said.
over time, mr. Smallwood said 
he began to understand that 
many of the most enduring 
works of praise have come from a 
place of sorrow.
“Songs of pain last,” he told 
The Post in 2015. “They make a 
difference. my prayer has always 
been, ‘Give me songs that last.’ I 
want my songs to last after I’m 
gone.”

through Christ. He 
takes care of it all.”

Protests after Israel 
recognizes  Somaliland
Tens of thousands of Somalis 
gathered across the country 
Tuesday to protest Israel’s 
recognition of the breakaway 
region of Somaliland, a move 
condemned by more than 20 
countries as an attack on the East 
African nation’s sovereignty. 
Meanwhile, Somali President 
Hassan Sheikh Mohamud arrived 
in Turkey on Tuesday for talks 
with President Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan, following Israel’s 
announcement. 
 At a U.N. Security Council 
emergency meeting Monday, 
Somalia protested the 
recognition, saying it poses 
regional security issues. The 
Israeli representative decried 
those comments as a double 
standard because other nations 
have recognized a state of 
Palestine. 
Somaliland, a territory of more 
than 3 million people in the Horn 
of Africa, declared independence 
from Somalia in 1991 during a 
period of conflict that left the 
country fragile. Despite having its 
own government and currency, 
Somaliland had never been 
recognized by any nation until 
Israel did so Friday.
In the Somali capital, 
Mogadishu, crowds gathered at 
the main stadium for a rally led 
by prominent religious figures 
who condemned Israel’s 
recognition and called for unity 
in defense of Somalia’s territorial 
integrity. Similar protests were 
reported in other towns.
The combined demonstrations 
marked the largest turnout of 
protesters since Israel’s 
declaration.

Circumcision rituals 
blamed in 41 deaths 
At least 41 young men have 
died as a result of circumcision 
procedures as part of traditional 
initiation activities in South 
Africa in November and 
December, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
Traditionally, young men are 
isolated at initiation schools, 
where they are taught cultural 
values and responsibilities as 
they become adults. The 
circumcision part of the initiation 
results every year in the deaths of 
some initiates, forcing the 
government to intervene through 
legislation.
The laws force initiation 
schools to be registered with 
authorities, but this has not 
stopped the proliferation of 
illegal initiation schools where 
many of the deaths are reported. 
Initiation periods typically run 
during winter (June-July) and 
summer (November-December) 
school holidays.
South Africa’s traditional 
affairs minister, Velenkosini 
Hlabisa, told local broadcasters 
Tuesday that 41 initiates died 
during this year’s summer 
initiation. He blamed negligence 
on the part of both the initiation 
schools, including registered 
ones, and parents for not 
adhering to safety standards and 
medical advice.
Eastern Cape Province has 
been identified as a hot spot for 
the death of initiates, totaling 21 
so far.
Hlabisa said 41 people have 
been arrested in relation to illegal 
initiation schools, including 
parents who supplied wrong ages 
for their children to be admitted.

The number of shootings in 
Sweden has more than halved 
since hitting a peak in 2022, 
reflecting new policing 
approaches introduced by the 
right-wing government. Shooting 
incidents fell to 147 so  far this 
year, a 49 percent decrease 
compared with 2024. The 
number of fatalities, however, 
was unchanged from last year at 
43.
Israel says it is suspending 
humanitarian organizations 
that have failed to meet its new 
rules to vet international groups 
working in the Gaza Strip. They 
include some of the world’s most 
prominent and outspoken aid 
organizations, including Doctors 
Without Borders. The suspension 
begins Jan. 1. International 
organizations have said Israel’s 
rules are arbitrary and could 
endanger staff. Israel has accused 
militant groups of operating 
under the cover of international 
organizations, something the 
groups deny.

BERLIN — In a country known for 
its rule-abiding ways — quiet 
Sundays, meticulous recycling, 
orderly lines and an aversion to 
jaywalking even in the wee hours 
of the morning — there is one 
night each year when restraint 
collapses into sanctioned may-
hem.
On New Year’s Eve, known as 
“Silvester,” Germans of all ages 
flood the streets armed with fire-
works. But for some, it’s not about 
lighting up the sky, but often 
firing rockets directly at friends 
and unsuspecting strangers.
What was long considered a 
raucous celebration has increas-
ingly turned violent. In recent 
years, Silvester has left behind a 
trail of serious injuries, fires, and 
assaults on police and emergency 
workers, fueling a ferocious na-
tional debate over whether pri-
vate fireworks should be banned 
altogether.
Nowhere is the debate more 
intense than in the German capi-
tal.
Last New Year’s,  five people 
were killed across the country in 
fireworks-related 
incidents, 
while in Berlin alone, more than 
360 people sustained fireworks-
related injuries, according to the 
city’s 
health 
administration. 
Among the injured were emer-
gency services workers. More 
than 50 attacks on police officers 
were recorded, leaving 17 officers 
injured through criminal acts 
and eight by fireworks. A para-
medic was also targeted.
“We are attacked massively 
with firecrackers and rockets 
from a distance,” Jochen Kopelke, 
federal chairman of Germany’s 
Police Union, said in an inter-
view. “[The perpetrators] stand 
30 or 40 meters [100 feet] away 
and attack police officers from 
afar, which makes arrests almost 
impossible.”
Compared with most global 
capitals, New Year’s Eve in Berlin 
is unusually wild, with private 
fireworks taking center stage. Al-
though a public event is sched-
uled to host 20,000 people at 
Berlin’s iconic Brandenburg Gate 
this year, that figure is tiny com-
pared with London’s roughly 
100,000, New York’s 1 million or 
Sydney’s 1.5 million-plus at those 
cities’ main New Year’s Eve 
events.
The heated debate in Germany 
has since morphed into a broader 
political and cultural argument 
about citizen freedoms — on par 
with the country’s decades-long 
dispute over imposing a speed 
limit on the Autobahn.
In the wake of last year’s Silves-
ter, Germany’s former justice 
minister Marco Buschmann said 
in January that a complete ban on 
private fireworks would equate to 
“collective punishment.”
“Once a year, people should be 
given the freedom to observe this 
tradition,” he told German media 
group 
RedaktionsNetzwerk 
Deutschland  at the time.
Private fireworks are banned 
year-round in Germany, except 
for a short window around New 
Year’s Eve. By midafternoon on 
Dec. 31, the first explosions echo 
through Berlin neighborhoods. 
Dog owners unable to escape the 
city squeeze in a final long walk of 
the year. By dusk, firecrackers — 
known as “böller” — explode on 
sidewalks, forcing pedestrians to 
dodge stray sparks as they hurry 
home, or toward parties. The 
advice to newcomers and visitors 
is simple: If you don’t have to go 
out, don’t. Navigating parts of the 
city center becomes nearly im-
possible as midnight approaches.
As the clock strikes 12, the sky 
erupts in cascades of color as 
Berlin’s wild New Year’s Eve tradition fuels annual debate 
Over 2 million Germans have signed petitions calling for a ban on private fireworks after  five died  during ‘Silvester’ celebrations last year
rockets streak overhead. But be-
neath the spectacle, the oohs and 
aahs of onlookers are drowned 
out by sirens and the concussive 
booms of illegal pyrotechnics. 
What begins as celebration often 
curdles into what some residents 
describe as a night of terror. Even 
watching from a balcony can be a 
gamble, as stray fireworks whiz 
by, sometimes landing on terrac-
es and even setting entire apart-
ments ablaze.
To many Germans, the fire-
works are a menace. To some 
newcomers, they can pose an 
even greater risk. In December 
2015, months after hundreds of 
thousands of Syrian asylum seek-
ers arrived in Germany, authori-
ties warned that excessive fire-
works could retraumatize refu-
gees suffering from post-traumat-
ic stress from the war they had 
just fled.
By early New Year’s Day, a gray 
smog hangs over Berlin, and 
streets are littered with spent 
shells and debris.
The debate over banning pri-
vate pyrotechnics is as much a 
part of modern Silvester as the 
fireworks themselves. A recent 
Forsa poll found that about 
60 percent of Germans would 
support a ban on private fire-
works on New Year’s Eve. Now, 
two major petitions have pushed 
for that measure. One, from the 
“Böller Ciao” association — a nod 
to the Italian protest song “Bella 
Ciao”  — is backed by nearly 60 
organizations including environ-
mental groups and animal wel-
fare groups, and has gathered 
almost 800,000 signatures. A sec-
ond, by the Berlin Police Union, 
has reached 2.4 million support-
ers.
“Germany … continues to al-
low thousands of people to be 
injured every year for the amuse-
ment of a very small minority, 
cities to be buried in particulate 
matter, and millions of animals to 
flee in panic,” Jürgen Resch, fed-
eral managing director of Envi-
ronmental Action Germany, said 
in a statement.
Animal welfare advocates em-
phasize the toll on wildlife and 
pets. “Every year, New Year’s Eve 
fireworks cause stress and mortal 
fear for thousands of animals — 
pets, wild animals and farm ani-
mals experience days of extreme 
distress around the turn of the 
year due to the loud explosions, 
flashes of light and dense smoke,” 
said Volker Gaßner, managing 
director of Four Paws Germany.
“The number of firecrackers 
and rockets imported into Ger-
many is at a record high this year, 
promising a particularly horrific 
and distressing night,”  he added.
Both petitions were submitted 
to the state Interior Ministers’ 
Conference in early December to 
spur legislative change, but states 
less affected by firework-related 
violence have been reluctant to 
act. A nationwide ban would re-
quire changes to the federal Ex-
plosives Ordinance, and interior 
ministers have yet to agree. Crit-
ics say a blanket ban would be 
difficult to enforce, legally com-
plicated, socially unpopular and 
ineffective at curbing violence.
But it’s what happens on hospi-
tal floors and city streets that has 
sharpened the debate. Berlin cre-
ated several small firework-free 
zones after years of injuries, fires 
and attacks on emergency work-
ers in densely built neighbor-
hoods. The restrictions aim to 
protect residents, reduce risks 
from crowds and narrow streets, 
and limit extreme noise where 
celebrations 
have 
repeatedly 
spun out of control. But emergen-
cy services still find themselves in 
the line of fire, with 58 such cases 
recorded last Silvester. In total, 
Berlin police recorded 1,453 New 
Year’s Eve-related crimes a year 
ago  — 125 more than  the previous 
year.
The 
operation 
requires 
months of preparation. In 2024, 
roughly 3,000 police officers and 
1,500 firefighters were deployed 
across the capital.
Despite calling for a blanket 
ban, German Police Union chief 
Kopelke 
acknowledged 
that 
many people want a peaceful 
firework celebration, especially 
in quieter suburbs.
“A calm New Year’s Eve with 
the neighborhood is something 
wonderful,” he said. “But for the 
police, New Year’s Eve is extreme-
ly difficult.”
He advocates rethinking the 
tradition: “We have to find a way 
to redesign New Year’s Eve with a 
firework ban — while creating 
legal alternatives so people can 
still celebrate safely.”
Hospitals like Berlin’s Accident 
Hospital are bracing for another 
busy night. Georg Osterhoff, di-
rector of trauma surgery and 
orthopedics, recalls his first Sil-
vester shift nearly two decades 
ago. “The hand surgeon cried 
because she was simply over-
whelmed by the number of pa-
tients who came and by some of 
the images you see,” he said.
“Even for us as experienced 
surgeons, a mangled hand or a 
shattered face, especially in chil-
dren, is something that is very 
distressing,” Osterhoff said. The 
hospital reinforces staff by about 
20 percent for the night.
Despite his frontline experi-
ence, Osterhoff is skeptical that a 
blanket ban would solve the 
problem. “Personally, I believe 
that a ban won’t change the fact 
that some people don’t follow the 
rules,” he said. “And the rule 
already exists, so the vast majori-
ty of blast injuries we see are a 
result of improper, rule-breaking 
behavior, and therefore I believe 
that a ban wouldn’t achieve 
much.”
Opponents of a ban argue that 
critics focus too narrowly on vio-
lence, ignoring the social value of 
Silvester fireworks. Germany’s 
Federal Association for Pyrotech-
nics and Artistic Fireworks re-
jects a blanket ban, instead call-
ing for stricter enforcement 
against illegal devices and better 
safety education.
“We live in societies that are 
highly individualized, digitized, 
and where direct physical contact 
plays an increasingly smaller 
role,” said Felix Martens, head of 
the association. On New Year’s 
Eve, “we see our neighbors, greet 
them, wish them a happy new 
year and, above all, look together 
at this illuminated sky. And I 
think if that were to disappear, we 
would lose one of those very rare 
moments of social harmony.”

AND ABBIE CHEESEMAN
Saudi Arabia carried out an 
airstrike on the southern Yemen 
port city of Mukalla early Tues-
day, targeting what it described 
as weapons shipments bound for 
a separatist force backed by the 
United Arab Emirates that has 
moved to consolidate further 
control of southern Yemen in 
recent weeks.
The strike marked an unprece-
dented escalation of tensions be-
tween Saudi Arabia and the UAE, 
two Persian Gulf heavyweights 
that are ostensibly aligned in the 
fight against the Iranian-backed 
Houthis in Yemen but whose 
goals in that war-torn country, 
and the wider region, have in-
creasingly diverged.
Saudi Arabia “stresses that any 
threat to its national security is a 
red line, and the Kingdom will 
not hesitate to take all necessary 
steps and measures to confront 
any such threat,” its Foreign Min-
istry said in a statement Tuesday, 
in a sharp rebuke of its erstwhile 
ally.
Brig. Gen. Turki al-Malki, a 
spokesman for the Saudi-led co-
alition of forces backing Yemen’s 
internationally recognized gov-
ernment, said the strike was con-
ducted after two ships that de-
parted from the Emirati port of 
Fujairah arrived in Mukalla with-
out permits over the weekend 
and turned off their transpon-
ders.
“The port was closed and all 
local workers and employees 
were evacuated,” Malki said, after 
which the ships’ crew members 
unloaded “a large quantity of 
weapons and armored vehicles.” 
He said the weapons were des-
tined for the separatist Southern 
Transitional Council in the east-
ern provinces of Hadramawt and 
Mahra and that Saudi authorities 
warned “high-level officials in 
the UAE” against allowing the 
transfer to move forward.
When they didn’t comply, Mal-
ki said, “the Coalition Air Forces 
conducted a limited military op-
eration targeting weapons and 
combat vehicles unloaded from 
the two ships at the port of 
Al-Mukalla.” Videos circulating 
on social media and verified by 
Storyful show smoke rising from 
the blackened husks of several 
military vehicles at the port.
In a statement Tuesday, the 
UAE Foreign Ministry disputed 
Saudi Arabia’s characterization 
of its role in Yemen and rejected 
claims that it had pressured “any 
Yemeni party to carry out mili-
tary operations” that threaten 
Saudi Arabia or its borders.
The statement expressed sur-
prise at the strike and denied that 
the shipment to Yemen had con-
tained weapons. It said the vehi-
cles within were not destined for 
“any Yemeni party” but rather for 
UAE forces in Yemen. Later, the 
UAE Defense Ministry said it was 
planning to pull its remaining 
counterterrorism teams from Ye-
men. The UAE withdrew most of 
its troops from the country in 
2019.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio 
spoke with his Saudi counterpart 
about developments in Yemen, 
the department’s deputy spokes-
man, Tommy Pigott, said in a 
statement Tuesday.
The Trump administration has 
mostly remained quiet as ten-
sions between its gulf allies heat-
ed up in recent weeks. On Friday, 
Rubio said the United States was 
“concerned by recent events in 
southeastern Yemen.”
“We urge restraint and contin-
ued diplomacy, with a view to 
reaching a lasting solution,” he 
said in a statement.
The escalation comes after STC 
forces swept across Hadramawt 
and Mahra earlier this month, 
driving out Saudi-backed forces 
in a takeover of vast swaths of 
Yemen that border Saudi Arabia 
and Oman. The STC, established 
in 2017, is part of the Presidential 
Leadership Council, an uneasy 
alliance of political figures in 
southern Yemen that together 
form the executive body of the 
internationally recognized gov-
ernment.
Members of the council — and 
their Persian Gulf backers — 
share the aim of countering the 
Houthis, the Iranian-backed reb-
el movement that took control of 
Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014, 
sparking a civil war. But Saudi 
Arabia supports a unified Yemen, 
while the Emirati-backed STC 
seeks to reestablish a separate 
state in southern Yemen that 
existed for about two decades 
before its dissolution in 1990.
The STC’s lightning offensive 
this month appeared to have 
caught Saudi Arabia by surprise, 
and tensions continued to sim-
mer as Saudi Arabia weighed its 
response.
Late last week, Saudi Arabia 
hit an area of Hadramawt where 
STC forces were attempting to 
advance, in what Saudi-aligned 
media described as a “warning 
airstrike.” On Saturday, Malki 
threatened that the Saudi-led co-
alition would intervene unless 
the STC withdraws from the terri-
tory it seized.
Last-ditch diplomatic efforts 
to contain the crisis failed, 
Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen 
analyst for the International Cri-
sis Group, said in a phone inter-
view after meeting last week with 
Saudi and Yemeni officials in the 
Saudi capital of Riyadh.
The Saudi statement Tuesday, 
in which Riyadh directly accused 
the Emirati government of being 
behind the STC offensive, was the 
most strongly worded warning to 
the UAE from the kingdom to 
date.
“The steps taken by the UAE 
are considered highly dangerous, 
inconsistent with the principles 
upon which the Coalition to Re-
store Legitimacy in Yemen was 
established, and do not serve the 
coalition’s purpose of achieving 
security and stability for Yemen,” 
it said, referring to the Saudi-led 
military coalition.
The Saudi Foreign Ministry 
also endorsed Tuesday a call from 
Yemen’s internationally recog-
nized government for Emirati 
forces to leave the country within 
24 hours, demanding the UAE 
“halt any military or financial 
support to any party within Ye-
men.”
President Rashad al-Alimi, the 
Riyadh-backed head of the inter-
nationally recognized govern-
ment, canceled a joint defense 
agreement with the UAE, de-
clared a 90-day state of emergen-
cy in Yemen, and announced an 
air, sea and land embargo on all 
ports and border crossings for 72 
hours. He called on all forces in 
Hadramawt and Mahra to with-
draw and hand over their posi-
tions to a Saudi-backed force.
Four members of the Presiden-
tial Leadership Council con-
demned Alimi’s moves to cancel 
the defense pact and expel Emir-
ati forces from the country. 
Hisham al-Jabri, chief of staff for 
one of the council members, 
Faraj Salmin al-Bahsani, said in a 
text message that he expected 
Tuesday’s strike to accelerate ef-
forts by the STC to declare an 
independent state in southern 
Yemen.
The emerging rift between 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE would 
be consequential for the region, 
according to Farea Al-Muslimi, a 
research fellow at Chatham 
House, a London-based think 
tank.
“They are countries that are 
powerful,” he said. “They have 
weapons. They have no parlia-
ments. There is no way to hold 
them accountable, and they have 
big egos. Saudi Arabia and the 
UAE have never gone after each 
other like this in the past. This is 
very dangerous.”
While Saudi Arabia and the 
UAE “share a close strategic 
alignment with the U.S.,” said 
Adam Baron, future security fel-
low at New America, a D.C.-based 
think tank, “their own regional 
strategies 
have 
increasingly 
clashed with each other.”
“We’ve seen this in Yemen, 
Sudan, Somalia,” he said in a 
phone interview. “We’ve seen this 
in the Red Sea, and now we’re 
seeing the — far from inevitable 
and, as of yet, still relatively 
limited — conflagration of these 
tensions.”
Those differing regional strat-
egies have publicly come to a 
head on multiple fronts in recent 
weeks, Baron said, pointing to 
recent developments in Sudan 
and Somalia. President Donald 
Trump said last month that Saudi 
Crown Prince Mohamed bin Sal-
man had requested that Wash-
ington work toward a solution to 
the conflict in Sudan, where Ri-
yadh and the UAE government 
back opposing forces.
Israel’s formal recognition last 
week of Somaliland, a breakaway 
region that seceded from Somalia 
more than three decades ago, is 
also likely to have incentivized 
Riyadh to rebalance power dy-
namics, Baron said. The UAE 
maintains a military presence 
there and abstained from an Arab 
League statement condemning 
Israel’s move.
Arab states — and the broader 
international community — are 
likely to take Saudi Arabia’s side 
in Yemen, Muslimi said.
An early sign of support came 
in the form of a statement Tues-
day from Ahmed Aboul Gheit, 
secretary general of the Arab 
League. It expressed “profound 
concern over the rapidly escalat-
ing and dangerous develop-
ments,” including the STC’s “fail-
ure to respond” to the Saudi-
backed government’s demands.
Oman, which borders Mahra 
in southeastern Yemen, also 
called Tuesday for de-escalation 
and dialogue to resolve the crisis.
In Yemen, Muslimi said, ordi-
nary citizens will pay the price as 
regional powers pursue their 
own aims.
“Yemenis will continue to be 
caught in the middle of enemies 
— and even worse, of friends,” he 
said.

BY LOVEDAY MORRIS 
AND LIOR SOROKA
Standing 
side-by-side 
with 
President Donald Trump outside 
his residence in Palm Beach, Flor-
ida, dressed in a twinning suit 
and tie, Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu grinned as 
the U.S. leader responded to a 
question from a reporter about 
whether his Israeli counterpart 
should be pardoned in his trial for 
bribery and fraud.
“He’s a wartime prime minister 
who is a hero,” Trump said. “How 
do you not give a pardon? I think 
it’s a very hard thing not to do it.”
While the meeting on Monday 
at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate fo-
cused on pressing Middle East 
issues such as Iran and Trump’s 
20-point peace plan for Gaza, for 
Netanyahu, it was also a domestic 
power play.
The premier’s visit to the Unit-
ed States, which is expected to 
conclude on Thursday, paused his 
cross-examination in Case 4000, 
in which Netanyahu is charged 
with bribery and fraud for alleg-
edly advancing regulatory deci-
sions in exchange for favorable 
press coverage. Netanyahu has 
denied all charges and described 
the case as a “witch hunt.”
The trip also gave Netanyahu a 
public relations boost ahead of 
elections in Israel in the new year. 
They will be the first since the 
Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, 
which shattered his security cre-
dentials in the eyes of much of the 
public. During their joint news 
conference, Trump repeatedly 
praised Netanyahu, saying that if 
there had been another leader in 
place on Oct. 7, it’s possible “Israel 
would not exist” right now.
“Trump gave him his campaign 
for the next elections,” Gershon 
Baskin, an Israeli commentator 
and former back-channel negoti-
ator with Hamas, said of Trump’s 
praise, describing the news con-
ference as “bewildering.”
“All he has to do is keep repeat-
ing: ‘Without Netanyahu, Israel 
doesn’t exist,’” Baskin said.
Netanyahu’s critics have ac-
cused him of dragging out region-
al conflicts and amping up al-
leged threats from Iran to distract 
from his legal woes and the deep-
er probing of the security failings 
that led to the Hamas attacks.
Out of 60 scheduled hearings 
since Netanyahu’s trial testimony 
officially began in June, only 15 
have gone ahead without being 
canceled or cut short, according 
to a count by Israeli newspaper 
Haaretz. The prime minister has 
blamed ongoing conflicts or secu-
rity concerns for canceling more 
than a dozen sessions.
But ever a political survivor, 
Netanyahu, 
Israel’s 
longest-
serving prime minister, has man-
aged to cling to his position as a 
seemingly endless slew of domes-
tic scandals and investigations 
have nipped at his heels.
In recent days, Israeli media 
outlets have published reports 
detailing what they said were 
missed warnings from Egypt 
about the security situation in 
Gaza ahead of Oct. 7. At the same 
time, what is known in Israel as 
“Qatargate” — an allegation that 
members of the prime minister’s 
office were paid by Qatar to pro-
mote its interests — has returned 
to haunt Netanyahu as potential 
new details were leaked online.
Opposition politicians in Israel 
have described the Qatar-related 
accusation as an act of treason 
and demanded Netanyahu’s res-
ignation.
In Gaza, Netanyahu and his 
right-wing coalition have been 
reluctant to move forward with a 
U.S.-backed ceasefire agreement 
that was brokered in October. The 
deal, hailed by Trump, brought 
much of Israel’s military actions 
to a halt.
But the next phase could pave 
the way for a return of the Pales-
tinian Authority, the body that 
governs 
the 
Palestinian-con-
trolled parts of the West Bank, as 
well as new Palestinian police 
forces and near-total Israeli with-
drawal.
Baskin is among those in Israel 
who view Netanyahu’s renewed 
focus on Iran, which he says is 
rebuilding its missile capacity af-
ter Israeli strikes in June, as an 
effort to distract attention from 
Gaza.
Ahead of the meeting in Flori-
da, there was an expectation that 
“Trump is going to let Bibi have it” 
over Gaza, said Michael Oren, a 
former Israeli ambassador to the 
United States. But the appearance 
by the two leaders appeared to be 
“pretty much a love fest,” he said.
Oren said one of the most re-
markable comments came from 
Trump when he pledged potential 
military action against Iran. “I 
hope they’re not trying to build up 
again,” Trump said of Tehran’s 
missile arsenal. The U.S. also car-
ried out strikes against Iranian 
nuclear sites in June. “Because if 
they are, we’re going to have no 
choice but very quickly to eradi-
cate that buildup,” he said.
Despite criticism from his 
MAGA base that he is prioritizing 
foreign policy over domestic is-
sues, “Trump put a credible mili-
tary threat back on the table,” 
Oren said, adding that Netanya-
hu’s decision to tell Trump he had 
been awarded the Israel Prize, the 
state’s highest cultural honor, ap-
pealed to the president’s ego.
“It’s one of these Bibi strokes of 
brilliance that he does occasional-
ly,” Oren said, employing a com-
monly used nickname for Netan-
yahu.
The prime minister is legally 
obliged to hold elections this year. 
His right-wing Likud party took a 
beating in public opinion polls 
after Oct. 7, but has clawed its way 
back to the top spot, with a slim 
lead over its nearest rival.
“Netanyahu will conduct polls 
over the weekend, and if the nee-
dle moves even slightly, I believe 
he will trigger elections,” said 
Gayil Talshir, a political scientist 
at the Hebrew University in Jeru-
salem. “He won’t find a better 
jumping-off point than this.”
But while his appearance with 
Trump appeared outwardly as a 
win for Netanyahu, it was unclear 
exactly what took place at the 
meeting behind closed doors. 
Trump said that Hamas would be 
given a “very short period to dis-
arm,” or there would be “hell to 
pay” if the militant group did not 
comply. Other countries, he said, 
are prepared to go in and “wipe 
them out.”
Trump has struggled, however, 
to get countries to sign onto a 
stabilization force for Gaza, 
which would monitor the en-
clave’s demilitarization. The few 
nations that have expressed some 
willingness to join were clear that 
they do not want to confront 
Hamas.
Still, the president and his 
team are committed to rolling out 
the next phase of the plan and 
establishing a Palestinian techno-
cratic committee for Gaza, Baskin 
said.
On Iran, while Trump said he 
would support military action, he 
also said that the missile buildup 
was not confirmed.
“The American method is to 
provide public backing while dic-
tating what will happen behind 
closed doors, and in my estima-
tion, that is exactly what oc-
curred,” Talshir said. Netanyahu 
has little ability to resist U.S. 
demands conveyed behind the 
scenes, she said.
“Excessive compliments come 
with a price,” Yossi Verter, a politi-
cal analyst and columnist at 
Haaretz, wrote. 
He pointed to Trump’s break 
with Netanyahu on the role of 
Turkey in Gaza. Israel is adamant-
ly opposed to allowing Turkish 
forces enter the enclave as part of 
the stabilization force. But Trump 
waved away those concerns, say-
ing Turkish President Recep Tayy-
ip Erdogan is “a very good friend 
of mine.”
“I do respect him and Bibi 
respects him, and they’re not go-
ing to have a problem,” he said.
In the meantime, Netanyahu 
invited Trump to Israel to receive 
his award in April, an opportunity 
for the prime minister to get 
another boost for his campaign, 
critics said.
“It will be a massive festival, 
which Netanyahu will milk for all 
it’s worth,” Verter wrote. “Just a 
few months before the elections.”

casualty
in
President
Donald
Trump’s simmering contest with
China for influence over the key
waterway.
The small park meant to honor
the Central American nation’s
large ethnic Chinese population
had been slowly decaying, despite
the objections of community lead-
ers. Its crumbling obelisk and
taped-off friendship arch became
a symbol of Panama’s shift away
from Beijing under pressure from
Washington.
Now, local authorities have top-
pled both structures.
The Mirador de las Américas

under municipal orders, sparking
an end-of-year scandal in Panama
that has roped in Chinese foreign
officials and prompted the Pana-
manian president to call for an
investigation.
Theepisodehasfurtherescalat-
ed tensions in Panama over for-
eign influence by the United
States and China over the canal,
whichservesasakeywaterwayfor
some 40 percent of U.S. container
traffic.
Trump in January repeatedly
claimed that Beijing runs the wa-
terway and vowed to “take back”
control — including by force, if
necessary.
Stefany Peñalba, the mayor of
the bedroom community where
the overlook is located, character-
ized the decision to take down the
monument as a technical, preven-
tativemeasureandsaiditwas“not
in response to any political pres-
sure.”
But Panamanian President José
Raúl Mulino, who vowed to probe
Peñalbaoverthelegalityoftheinci-
dent, called it an “unforgivable, ir-
rational act” in a statement that
echoed some of the concerns
lodgedbyChina’sForeignMinistry.
Panama’s Chinese community
has“beenestablishedinourcoun-
try for generations and deserves
ourfullrespect,”hewroteonsocial
media on Monday.
The U.S. Embassy in Panama
and the State Department did not
respond to requests for comment.
In Panama, Mulino has pushed
back against some of Trump’s
most aggressive rhetoric on the
canal but generally aligned him-
self with the United States.
Over the summer, he rejected
the notion that the overlook site
was getting roped into geopoliti-
cal tensions — even as he and his
top officials have taken moves to
align themselves with Washing-
ton.
After Secretary of State Marco
Rubio threatened action over the
canal, Panama in February be-
came the first Latin American
country to pull out of the Belt and
Road Initiative, China’s signature
foreign infrastructure program.
His government made deals to
let the U.S. take down telecommu-
nications towers owned by a Chi-
nese company and to allow U.S.
military forces to return to three
largely vacant training facilities
near the waterway.
Thatagreement,DefenseSecre-
tary Pete Hegseth said, was meant
to keep Panama from “capitulat-
ing to coercion by the communist
Chinese.”
The canal was built by the U.S.
and controlled by Washington un-
til 1999, when it was handed over
to
an
independent
authority
linked to the Panamanian govern-
ment.
At
his
inaugural
address,
Trump accused Panama of charg-
ing U.S. ships and firms higher
fees to transit the canal — a claim
the authority denies.
Neither he nor his ambassador
to Panama have explicitly brought
up the overlook site, but some
Chinese Panamanian community
leaders raised skepticism about
how that geopolitical battle might
be influencing the fate of the mon-
ument — and, as a consequence,
their ethnic community’s stand-
ing.
Peñalba, the mayor, posted ren-
derings earlier this year of the
canal
overlook
on
Instagram
showingtheparkwithoutthearch
or obelisk. When Chinese Pana-
manian community groups sent
multiplepleasseekingpermission
to repair the site, she did not an-
swer.
TonyJiang,thepresidentofone
such group, the Fayen Beneficiary
Society, said the monument’s re-
moval seemed to confirm their
worst fears.
“This monument belongs to the
Panamanian people. She doesn’t
have the right to change Panama-
nian history,” he told local news
reporters by the overlook the
night it was toppled. “For us as
Panamanians of Chinese descent,
it’s painful. For all Panamanians,
it’s painful.”
Groups like his have walked a
fine line — and sometimes faced
internal divisions — between sep-
arating themselves entirely from
Beijing and advocating for Bei-
jing’s political or economic pres-
ence in Panama, particularly be-
cause some members maintain
business ties to China.
But his words appeared to echo
those of the Chinese ambassador
to Panama, Xu Xueyuan, who said
the fallout over the monument’s
removal was “at once indignant
and inspiring” and suggested it
could help boost Chinese influ-
ence in Panama.
The pushback from Mulino and
others had shown “the national
will and generous culture in Pana-
ma of respecting history and valu-
ing diversity and solidarity,” she
said in a statement. “As the Chi-
nese proverb says: Fortune and
misfortune go hand in hand.”

for a very long time and “with sticks, if 
necessary.”
“Everyone wants to go home. Everyone 
wants all of this to end. But even tired people 
carry out their tasks,” he said.
return of the heroes
How does a nation sell to its people a war 
that is destroying the country — and how does 
it ensure that it continues?
To keep the war effort rolling and to stave 
off discontent, the Kremlin has poured money 
into projects supporting soldiers and veter-
ans, including the nationwide Defender of the 
fatherland State foundation, which was es-
tablished in 2023 by Putin and is led by his 
niece, Deputy Defense minister Anna Tsivale-
va.
for their sacrifice, soldiers are rewarded 
with financial benefits, social prestige, and 
significant employment and education op-
portunities for themselves and their children.
Denis Poltavsky lost the sight in his right 
eye after he was swarmed by drones in battle 
last year. Unwilling to share many details 
about his time on the front, Poltavsky said he 
suffered from extreme PTSD, haunted by 
nightmares and insomnia.
But without a doubt, he says his life has 
materially improved since returning home. 
“The support is very extensive. The state is 
doing everything for veterans and soldiers. … 
They didn’t abandon us. They keep track of 
you and provide everything.”
Poltavsky was paid an initial $51,000 for his 
injury, plus insurance and a military pension. 
He has access to free transport, and tickets to 
museums and theaters. He recently complet-
ed Belgorod’s Time of our Heroes manage-
ment and leadership training, and hopes to 
soon receive a grant for his metalworking 
business.
Veterans also have access to round-the-
clock support from psychologists, doctors, 
caregivers and volunteers; they are given tax 
breaks and secure employment, even with 
disabilities. Belgorod’s program is even offer-
ing veterans free land on which to build a 
common opinion: People want to go to odesa 
on vacation again,” Gribova said. “for us, this 
is a civil war between russians and russians 
who have forgotten a bit that they are 
russians, that’s all.”
Belgorod and residents of russia’s regions 
bordering Ukraine form part of what pro-
Kremlin sociologist Valery fyodorov, the di-
rector of VCIom polling institution, has 
defined as “warring russia”: a minority of the 
country — roughly 20 percent — consisting of 
soldiers, their families, patriotic volunteers 
and workers in military factories who consid-
er the war vital for russia’s survival and who 
are pushing for victory. The rest, he says, are 
either passively loyal, indifferent to the war, 
opposed to it but taking refuge in their private 
lives, or living in exile.
Dmitry, a deputy commander of a grenade-
launcher platoon in russia’s 116th special 
purpose brigade, said that russia would fight 
are parties, people having fun, going on 
vacations. How is that possible? Here blood is 
being spilled, and there they’re celebrating. 
How can they reconcile that?”
Several volunteers said they had noticed a 
lull in donations since the start of the year, as 
many expected the war to end soon. Yevgenia 
Gribova, 35, who coordinates a center in 
Belgorod, said the volunteer movement is 
facing a crisis. In the first year, she said, 
people were spending the last of their rubles 
to support the troops, working constantly, 
without days off or vacation.
“Now people want to rest. They want to 
spend money on themselves rather than on 
materials for the front lines,” she said.
But while people said they want to see an 
end to the conflict, some also spoke of their 
desire to keep fighting and the need to end the 
war under the “right” conditions.
“Everyone still wants to take odesa. It’s a 
PHOTOs bY FrANcEscA EbEl/THE WAsHINGTON POsT
end. … It feels like it’s only just begun.”
Scenes like this one remain invisible to 
most russians, erased by state propaganda 
and glossy government projects supporting 
returning veterans. But inside the country, 
fatigue and resentment are festering beneath 
the suppression of dissent.
There is no outlet for public frustration and 
no relief from the mounting national exhaus-
tion with a nearly four-year-long war that is 
corroding the country from within and mak-
ing society more dysfunctional, broken and 
paranoid, according to observers and those 
interviewed for this article.
over the past year, the russian economy 
has lurched from spectacular growth to near 
stagnation. russia’s digital repression and 
isolation are deepening as more apps and 
platforms are banned. According to Western 
intelligence, more than a million russian 
fighters have been killed or wounded — many 
in battles for marginal gains. And as moscow’s 
search for internal enemies intensifies, its 
machine of repression is turning on its own 
children and patriots.
During russian President Vladimir Putin’s 
meeting with his Human rights Council this 
month, film director Alexander Sokurov 
spoke out against censorship, the country’s 
suffocating foreign agent laws, the rising cost 
of living and the lack of opportunities for 
young people. “If russia doesn’t change how 
it works with young people, it faces a dead 
end,” he said. Putin said he would respond 
later to his grievances.
A former senior Kremlin official told The 
Post that he was “very worried” about the 
“dark picture inside russia.”
“We can’t turn the clock back easily; 
political will is needed to reverse this, and it 
simply does not exist,” the former official said, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity to 
freely discuss sensitive matters.
Bearing the brunt
In Belgorod, a russian border city that once 
enjoyed close links to Ukraine’s Kharkiv — 
just 46 miles to the southwest — the price of 
this war is particularly tangible.
Daily drone attacks have long become part 
of the routine here. mud-spattered ambulanc-
es and camouflaged air-defense units tear 
through the center of town. The city’s volun-
teer networks — an integral part of the war 
effort that has supported the troops with 
clothing, food and equipment where the 
government has failed — continue to work 
around-the-clock, with retirees sewing anti-
drone netting and 3D-printing plastic bomb 
casings for drones.
Despite the suffering and mass destruction 
taking place just across the border, Belgorod 
regards itself as the main victim of this war. 
The city illustrates the widening gap in 
russian society between the indifferent, met-
ropolitan majority and the “warring” few.

the guitarist, fist-bumped one of his friends as 
he exited the courthouse. Officially, they stood 
accused of blocking the entrance to a metro 
station during an impromptu street concert 
this autumn, but their true crime was their 
viral performances of anti-war songs.
To many, the consequences of Stoptime’s 
performances were inevitable. But the young 
musicians’ case sent a chill through this 
still-liberal Baltic city, where street perfor-
mances are an integral part of local culture.
Copycat acts and musicians performing in 
solidarity with the imprisoned band members 
in the Urals and other cities in Russia were 
also arrested and charged as security services 
moved swiftly to crack down on the slightest 
flicker of dissent. Now, even singing the 
wrong kind of music can get you jailed, a 
development many regard as a return to the 
days of the Soviet Union.
The hearing in St. Petersburg was tense, at 
times Kafkaesque, as the defense lawyer 
unpacked the details of the performance in 
question. “There are approximately 47 meters 
between the entrance to the metro and the 
spot where they were performing. It is there-
fore impossible that the people who stood in a 
circle around Stoptime could have blocked 
that space,” she said.
Loginova, known by her stage name, 
Naoko, spent the last 20 minutes in the 
courtroom clasping her mother’s hands. “I 
really hope this is the last time they arrest 
me,” she whispered. Irina, her mother, smiled 
and held her daughter close, looking dazed. 
“Don’t you remember that they said that they 
would let you go on the first night? It’s now 
been a month.”
What made Stoptime’s rebellious music 
performances so striking was that they came 
at a time when free, creative spaces and 
opportunities to escape are fading fast.
“The very fact that they performed such 
songs was captivating,” said Ivan, 26, a history 
teacher, who attended many of their perfor-
mances. “It was like an echo of normal life in 
our time. These are songs you want to listen 
to: They are kind, they’re meaningful, they 
promote universal human values, they re-
mind that you can overcome things.”
He said in Russia right now the state is 
trying to build a strict loyalty based on 
behaving a certain way “in order to simply 
exist.” Around him he’s watched people accept 
a situation they were once horrified by and 
shift into a survival mode.
On Nov. 23, the Stoptime musicians were 
secretly and unexpectedly released, and they 
immediately fled the country. They were 
spotted in early December in Yerevan, Arme-
nia, still performing the same opposition 
songs that got them arrested.
Others have not been so lucky.
Tatiana Balazeikina’s 19-year-old son, Ye-
gor, is three years into his seven-year sentence 
for terrorism after he attempted to throw a 
molotov cocktail at a local military registra-
tion office in 2023. Yegor is one of hundreds of 
teenagers and children arrested for anti-war 
protests, sabotage or treason since the war.
“Stoptime were singing what so many 
people already had on the tip of their 
tongues,” said Balazeikina from her home an 
hour south of St. Petersburg. “This is dissent. 
And the only way for this state to remain what 
it is is to cut off all these signs of dissent right 
at the root.”
She believes young people present a special 
kind of threat to the Kremlin.
“These young people who essentially have 
nothing to lose except their freedom are very 
dangerous,” she said. “And if those young 
people are not only capable of thinking but 
can also sing what they think … that’s an even 
bigger threat.”
Natalia Abbakumova in riga, latvia, contributed to 
this report.
seeing how people begin to oppose each other 
as well, deciding which of them is more 
patriotic,” said military blogger Mikhail 
Zvinchuk, the founder of the Rybar Telegram 
channel, which has links to the Defense 
Ministry.
He added that the movement became 
corrupt and embezzled funds that were raised 
to support the troops. “Over the years, there 
have been a number of crooks who are trying 
to exploit the war.”
In Russia’s second city of St. Petersburg, 
security services have found a different tar-
get: teenagers.
At the Izmailsky courthouse last month, 
masked police officers escorted two teenage 
musicians from their hearing to the secret 
service cars waiting outside. The pair, 18-year-
olds Diana Loginova and Alexander Orlov — 
from the street band Stoptime — had just had 
their arrest extended for a third time. Orlov, 
Putin’s invasion, have gone on to criticize 
corruption and shortcomings in the army. 
The most radical of their leaders, such as 
ultranationalist hawk Igor Strelkov, were 
initially jailed. But this fall, they saw their 
ranks swept by an unexpected purge as the 
whole movement became the focus of repres-
sion.
In September, authorities branded Roman 
Alyokhin, a prominent blogger with 151,000 
subscribers on Telegram, a foreign agent, a 
label usually reserved for liberal opposition 
figures. In October, blogger Tatyana Montyan 
was declared a “terrorist and extremist.” 
Another, Oksana Kobeleva, was detained by 
the police. All had publicly criticized senior 
officials or other propagandists. The Z com-
munity has since turned on itself, with 
bloggers racing to denounce one another.
“The moment of unity did not last very 
long, and after almost four years, we are 
house.
Middlebury College professor Will Pyle, 
who studies Russia’s economy, has found that 
in some regions a larger share of Russians 
report being satisfied with their lives than at 
any time during the decade preceding the 
February 2022 invasion. The finding is based 
on analysis of data from the Russian Longitu-
dinal Monitoring Survey, which is maintained 
by Moscow’s Higher School of Economics.
According to Pyle’s research, conducted 
with the Bank of Finland, the increase in 
reported life satisfaction is especially pro-
nounced in regions whose economies have 
benefited from wartime and military-adja-
cent industrial production.
This mirrors Fyodorov’s research. “The 
more depressed the region, the more people 
have noticed their improvement in life,” he 
said.
But underneath the lionizing of the soldiers 
and this temporary uptick in prosperity is the 
darker impact of returning veterans and the 
longer-term social consequences of the inva-
sion. Already, horrific murders, rapes and 
crimes have been committed by returning 
soldiers, and many of the convicted criminals 
who signed contracts to win their freedom 
have returned home to commit more crimes.
“Every governor in Russia knows that a 
wave of problems is coming with the soldiers 
returning home from the front with serious 
post-traumatic stress disorder,” said a Krem-
lin insider, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the 
issue. “And they know the responsibility to 
deal with this will fall to them.”
The patriots and the teens
Since the start of the war, Russia has gone 
after its dissenters, pursuing LGBTQ+ people, 
artists and opposition figures, and made 
criticism of the conflict and the military 
illegal. But now, some of the state’s most 
fervent supporters are running into trouble as 
well.

faced with 
increasing 
pressure from 
much of the world 
over Israel’s 
bombardment of 
Gaza and the sprawling 
humanitarian disaster that 
resulted, Israeli Prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu invoked a 
vision of a vanished Greek 
 city-state.
With some Western 
governments restricting 
weapons transfers to Israel, the 
country must adopt a “super 
Sparta” mentality in the face of 
increasing isolation, summoning 
the famed self-reliance and 
martial resolve of ancient Sparta 
to boost the Israeli arms 
industry and hunker down, 
Netanyahu said in a September 
address.
But that was not the complete 
vision he set out: “We’re going to 
be Athens and super Sparta 
combined,” he said, unwilling to 
abandon entirely the more 
enlightened, democratic mythos 
of Sparta’s historical rival.
The emphasis on “super 
Sparta” stuck in the news cycle 
and provoked a backlash. 
Netanyahu was laying out a 
vision for a more militarized 
society that, like Sparta, would 
also be more closed to the 
outside world. His Israeli 
opponents despaired for what 
that would entail.
Even if Sparta’s autarky — its 
lack of a reliance on trade and 
economic ties to others — 
underlay its fierce reputation, 
that’s hardly a virtue in a 
globalized age, critics in Israel 
argued. Instead, they viewed it 
as a recipe for decline. Their 
contention, like Netanyahu’s 
own reach for Sparta’s legacy, 
has a long lineage. Writing in the 
federalist Papers in 1787, as U.S. 
founding fathers debated the 
shape of their new polity against 
precedents in classical antiquity, 
Alexander Hamilton scoffed at 
the example of Sparta as “little 
better than a well-regulated 
camp,” addicted to war and 
lacking the economic vigor 
needed for a successful, 
sovereign republic.
Heading into 2026, there’s 
still something curiously potent 
about the allusion to Sparta. In 
many countries, the steady 
advance of illiberal, right-wing 
nationalist politics has come 
with border walls and military 
budgets to match. The waning of 
the postwar “rules-based” order 
and the apparent retreat of 
globalization — sped, in part, by 
President Donald Trump’s trade 
wars — has returned us to a kind 
of “Spartan” moment, some 
analysts say.
Swedish economic historian 
Johan Norberg’s new book, 
“Peak Human: What We Can 
Learn from the rise and fall of 
Golden Ages,” points to the 
eternal clash of Spartan and 
Athenian ideals. “The Greek 
historians talked about the 
Athenians always going out to 
explore, to acquire something 
new, to trade,” he said of the city-
state remembered for seeding 
trade routes and amassing 
maritime power across the 
eastern mediterranean. “The 
opposite is the Spartan ideal 
that you stay at home to try to 
protect what you already have.” 
The latter, he argued, is “a very 
appealing idea in times of 
trouble, when the world seems 
like a dangerous place.”
A sense of peril stalks the 
political discourse in the West 
and elsewhere. The White House 
and ideological fellow travelers 
in Europe cast migrants and the 
feckless liberal establishments 
that welcomed them as the 
drivers of a “civilizational” crisis. 
myths of Sparta shadow that 
rhetoric.
Some rioters who stormed the 
Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, wore 
Sparta-themed helmets. They 
also flew flags emblazoned with 
the Spartan idiom “molon Labe” 
— the laconic phrase that means 
“come and take it,” popularized 
through generations of 
Hollywood films that tell the 
story of Spartan defiance of a 
Persian emperor who would 
have them surrender their 
weapons. Almost 25 centuries 
after 300 Spartan hoplites and 
their allies tried to thwart the 
advance of the Persians at the 
Battle of Thermopylae, their 
sacrifice is still a canonical event 
in the Western imagination — 
and a constant font of memes for 
the West’s far right.
U.S. gun rights activists 
invoke “molon Labe” as a slogan, 
a rejection of anyone who would 
contravene their Second 
Amendment freedoms. martin 
Sellner, the Austrian neofascist 
who helped popularize the 
concept of “remigration” — that 
is, the mass removal or 
deportation of non-White 
migrants, whatever their status, 
echoed by Trump and other 
right-wing leaders — adopted a 
“Spartan shield” as the image of 
his movement. In 2022, Don 
Bolduc, a republican senatorial 
candidate in New Hampshire, 
carried around a similar version 
of the shield (stuck full of 
arrows, for further dramatic 
effect) during his failed 
campaign.
In Greece itself during the 
previous decade, the neofascist 
Golden Dawn party staged 
annual rallies at the historical 
site of Thermopylae. They would 
bear torches and flank a statue 
of legendary Spartan king 
Leonidas, chanting “Greece 
belongs to the Greeks!”
Golden Dawn was banned as a 
political party in 2020 for 
criminal offenses, but it was 
succeeded by a wave of 
influential far-right factions that 
entered Greece’s Parliament 
after elections in 2023. one of 
the more controversial parties in 
this cadre is named the 
Spartans.
Spartan themes have run 
through modern nationalism all 
along. “The Spartan chant, ‘We 
are what you were; we will be 
what you are,’” 19th-century 
french philologist Ernst renan 
wrote in his seminal treatise on 
the idea of a nation, “is, in its 
simplicity, the abridged hymn of 
every fatherland.” The Spartan 
reputation for strict discipline, 
obedience and respect for 
hierarchy shaped the ethos of 
military cadet schools in 
 mid-19th-century Prussia.
A half-decade ago, U.S. 
military planners cheered the 
United Arab Emirates as “little 
Sparta,” a recognition of the 
small kingdom’s ability to punch 
above its weight in the middle 
East (and not, one imagines, its 
hierarchical social system that 
separates Emirati citizens and 
wealthy expats from a vast 
underclass of foreign laborers). 
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth 
openly channels supposed 
Spartan values when he extols 
the newfound “warrior ethos” of 
the Trump administration, 
tightens the Pentagon’s 
standards for grooming and 
physical fitness, and links the 
mission of the U.S. military more 
closely to the White House’s 
political agenda.
Hegseth’s approach, warned 
Bret Devereaux, a historian of 
ancient armies, jeopardizes a 
more democratic civil-military 
tradition. “Hegseth’s ideal army 
is one quite a bit more like those 
of russia or Belarus: focused on 
the pageantry of physical fitness, 
prone to atrocity, and ultimately 
the tool of one man’s power 
rather than the shield of a free 
country,” Devereaux writes.
Norberg, separately, described 
societies like that of russia and 
Belarus as inimical to innovation 
and beholden to the barracks — 
“all Sparta, no Athens.”
Proponents of 
 neo-Spartanism see a world 
where “you’re better off if you 
stay at home, not engaging too 
much with others,” Norberg told 
me. “There’s very much the 
Spartan mentality — that the 
world is a zero-sum game, and if 
somebody else benefits, you’re 
worse off. And that seems to be 
the Trumpian worldview as well, 
and why Sparta is an ideal for 
people on the mAGA right.”
But it’s not just the right. 
Uncertain about the strength of 
U.S. commitments, European 
governments of various political 
persuasions are steeling 
themselves for the prospect of 
conflicts and investing in their 
defense capabilities.
In November, finnish 
President Alexander Stubb 
declared that the “decade of the 
army is about to begin.” German 
Chancellor friedrich merz said 
this month that “the decades of 
the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely 
over for us in Europe, and also 
for us in Germany. It no longer 
exists as we knew it and 
nostalgia won’t change that. … 
The Americans are now very, 
very ruthlessly pursuing their 
own self-interests.” It was time, 
merz suggested, for Europe to do 
the same.
Classical historians quibble 
with such blunt analogies. The 
past is always more complicated 
than how it’s remembered.
far from being the 
civilizational bulwark some on 
the Western right envision, 
Sparta was “reliant on naval 
subsidies from the Persian 
Empire” in the latter wars 
against Athens, Barry Strauss, a 
professor emeritus at Cornell 
and a senior fellow at the 
Hoover Institution, told me. “So 
it’s not entirely the image we 
have of Sparta as this autarkic 
place.”
right-wing idealization 
“exaggerates the degree to which 
Sparta was isolated and also 
underestimates the degree to 
which corruption was a problem 
in Sparta,” Strauss said.
Sparta did not have the grand 
public architecture of Athens 
that has survived through the 
ages to shape its memory. But it 
enforced a rigid social system 
that was a subject of fascination 
even in its day, interest in which 
has endured: A small class of 
citizens who did not engage in 
agriculture or commerce trained 
as warriors from childhood, with 
men living in communal 
barracks, supported by a vast 
class of enslaved farmers.
many resources were held in 
common by the citizen elites. 
Paul Cartledge, a British 
historian of ancient Greece and 
professor emeritus at Cambridge 
University, noted how Spartan 
women “somewhat break the 
mold in terms of the oppression 
or subjection of women in 
ancient Greece.”
Still, even by the standards of 
its own time, Cartledge argued, 
Sparta was notorious for its 
brutality. “Sparta is not a role 
model,” he told me. “It’s a slave 
state, and it’s extremely 
unpleasant to its unfree 
population.”
Cartledge pointed to the 
echoes of Sparta in Europe’s 
darkest chapter. “The Spartans 
were very cautious about whom 
they reared and whom they cast 
out,” he said, referring in part to 
their purported practice of 
exposing unfit infants. “They 
were, presumably, eugenicists.”
The Nazis remembered them 
as such. “Sparta must be 
regarded as the first völkisch 
state,” Adolf Hitler once said, 
referring to a racially ordered 
polity. “The exposure of the sick, 
weak, deformed children, in 
short, their destruction, was 
more decent and in truth a 
thousand times more human 
than the wretched insanity of 
our day which preserves the 
most pathological subject.”
Netanyahu’s “Athens and 
super Sparta” speech tapped 
into a long tradition. Cold War 
policymakers raised the parable 
of Sparta and Athens in regard 
to the Soviet-U.S. contest: The 
former, in its communalism and 
closed economic order, more 
“Spartan” in nature; the latter, 
with its maritime dominance 
and capitalist zeal, more 
“Athenian.”
Harvard political scientist 
Graham Allison updated the 
paradigm for the 21st century 
when he brought into the 
mainstream the idea of the 
“Thucydides trap,” mulling the 
inevitability of conflict between 
the United States and China. In 
this analogy, Washington is like 
Sparta, a great status quo power 
threatened by the rise of an 
ambitious, increasingly assertive 
Athens.
Allison is an avowed 
practitioner of “applied history,” 
sifting through precedents for 
modern-day lessons. The 
contemporary resonance of 
Sparta “is very interesting,” 
Allison told me, but, he added, 
there are limits to the power of 
the metaphor given the 
“profound differences” 
separating us from the city-state.
“When people cherry-pick one 
or two features of an analogy,” he 
said, “that will frequently tell 
you more about the person and 
their views than it will about the 
illumination of the world.”

mained at large in the two coun-
tries.
In Syria, Kurdish-led fighters, 
supported by the United States, 
guard Islamic State detainees as 
well as two camps that house 
tens of thousands of dependents 
that security experts worry are 
ripe for recruitment.
U.S. Central Command said in 
a statement that, in 2025, the 
Islamic State inspired at least 11 
plots or attacks against targets 
inside the U.S., though it did not 
provide details.
In response, it has conducted 
dozens of operations this year 
that have killed or captured as 
many as 300 Islamic State fight-
ers, Centcom said. one of those 
missions included a September 
operation that killed senior Is-
lamic State operative omar Ab-
dul Qader.
U.S. forces there will continue 
“to hunt down terrorist opera-
tives, eliminate ISIS networks, 
and work with partners to pre-
vent an ISIS resurgence,” Adm. 
Brad Cooper, Centcom’s com-
mander, said in a statement, 
using the acronym for the Islam-
ic State.
But the fledgling Syrian secu-
rity services have also been a 
concern — accused of perpetrat-
ing atrocities during sectarian 
fighting that killed thousands of 
people in the country’s coastal 
regions and in southern Syria. 
The new government’s forces 
have absorbed the constellation 
of rebel factions that fought for 
more than a decade against As-
sad — among them, foreign fight-
SYRIA from A1
ers and hard-line Islamists.
In the Palmyra attack, Cent-
com said a lone Islamic State 
militant who had been absorbed 
into Syria’s security forces fired 
on U.S. troops as they were 
conducting a “key leader engage-
ment,” similar to the force devel-
opment missions U.S. troops 
conducted in Iraq and Afghani-
stan.
The attack killed two members 
of the Iowa National Guard — 
Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, 
and Sgt. William Nathaniel How-
ard, 29 — along with Ayad man-
soor Sakat, 54, an Iraqi-born 
interpreter who lived in michi-
gan. Three other U.S. soldiers 
and two members of Syria’s secu-
rity forces were wounded in the 
ambush.
The revelation that the gun-
man was a member of Syria’s 
security services was a blow to 
Sharaa’s government, which has 
made strong relations with the 
U.S. a priority as the country 
emerges from a long civil war.
During a visit by Sharaa to the 
White House in November, the 
Trump 
administration 
an-
nounced that Syria had joined 
the anti-Islamic State global co-
alition — a stunning turn for 
Sharaa, who was once impris-
oned by U.S. forces in Iraq and 
went on to lead Syria’s al-Qaeda 
affiliate until his rebel forma-
tion, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, sev-
ered ties with the transnational 
extremist group in 2017.
Since the Palmyra assault, Syr-
ia’s Interior ministry has an-
nounced a series of raids target-
ing the Islamic State in several 
provinces, including operations 
it said swept up several leaders 
in Damascus province and in the 
country’s southwest.
The group is seen as a grave 
threat to Syria at an especially 
critical time, as the govern-
ment is trying to attract foreign 
investment and prevent sectari-
an tensions. Two shadowy re-
cent attacks have stirred fears 
among minorities: the deadly 
bombing of a church outside 
Damascus in June that officials 
blamed on the Islamic State and 
the bombing of a mosque that 
killed eight people on friday in 
an Alawite neighborhood in 
Homs. The authorities have not 
identified the perpetrator in the 
mosque attack.

Khaleda Zia, the first female 
prime minister of Bangladesh, 
died Dec. 30, her Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party said.
The BNP said she died at a 
hospital in the capital, Dhaka, 
with her son and other family 
members present. The statement 
did not provide a cause of death 
but said that she suffered from 
multiple health problems, in-
cluding cirrhosis, arthritis and 
diabetes, and that she was admit-
ted in November with infections 
in her heart and lungs.
She was 80, according to the 
statement, though her age was 
contested in Bangladesh, and the 
BNP in her biography listed her 
date of birth as Aug. 15, 1946. It 
did not immediately respond to a 
request for clarification.
Ms. Zia was first elected in 1991 
and served as prime minister of 
Bangladesh until 1996. She was 
reelected that year but stepped 
down the following month be-
cause of an opposition boycott, 
which meant 90 percent of voters 
had abstained from participating 
in the election. She was elected 
again in 2001 and governed until 
2006.
Ms. Zia was the first woman to 
lead the country and the second 
woman to govern a Muslim-ma-
jority country, the first being 
Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto.
Muhammad Yunus, the chief 
adviser of Bangladesh’s interim 
government, said in a statement 
shared on social media that Ms. 
Zia was a “symbol of the demo-
cratic movement.”
“Her role in the struggle to 
establish democracy, a multi-par-
ty political culture, and the rights 
of the people in Bangladesh will 
be remembered forever,” he said, 
adding, “The nation will remem-
ber her contributions to the 
country and its people with re-
spect.”
Ms. Zia became the leader of 
the BNP in 1984, three years after 
her husband, Ziaur Rahman, the 
former leader and the founder of 
the party, was killed in an at-
tempted military coup. She be-
came an outspoken advocate for 
democracy and was voted prime 
minister in elections found to be 
free and fair by international 
observers.
She was imprisoned multiple 
times throughout her long politi-
cal career, including in 2018 on 
corruption charges. She was also 
put under house arrest by the 
military regime that ruled before 
she became prime minister.
Ms. Zia spent the first part of 
her life as a quiet, high-school-ed-
ucated wife of the relatively pop-
ular general, The Washington 
Post reported in 1991. But the 
events of her life transformed her 
into a key political figure in 
Bangladeshi politics.
She was the longtime rival of 
Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s sec-
ond female prime minister, who 
was ousted by protesters last year 
and fled to India after ruling the 
country for 15 years. Ms. Zia’s and 
Hasina’s parties — the latter 
called the Awami League — have 
been the two main political 
groups in Bangladesh since 1991.
Ms. Zia was freed from house 
arrest last year after protesters 
took control of the country. Her 
party had long dismissed the 
charges against her — among 
them, that she had embezzled 
tens of thousands of dollars in 
donations meant for an orphan-
age trust — as false and politically 
motivated.
The U.S. State Department 
said in a 2023 report on human 
rights in Bangladesh that “inter-
national and domestic legal ex-
perts noted the lack of evidence 
to support the conviction and 
suggested a political ploy to re-
move the leader of the opposition 
from the electoral process.”
Ms. Zia was born before the 
partition of India at the end of the 
British colonial period and grew 
up in what was then East Paki-
stan, an entity split from the 
western portion of the country by 
a thousand miles of Indian terri-
tory.
East and West Pakistan shared 
a majority religion, Islam, but 
were ethnically and culturally 
distinct. The eastern part was 
majority Bengali, while the west-
ern part — where the national 
government and military leader-
ship were located — was majority 
Punjabi.
In 1960, Ms. Zia married Rah-
man, who would become a mili-
tary commander during Bangla-
desh’s war for independence 
from West Pakistan in 1971. Rah-
man read out Bangladesh’s decla-
ration of independence on a radio 
broadcast in March of that year, 
an important moment in the 
conflict.
Hundreds of thousands — up 
to 3 million, by some estimates — 
of Bengalis died during the war, 
as West Pakistan fought to pre-
vent its eastern portion from 
breaking away.
Rahman founded the Bangla-
desh Nationalist Party and was 
the country’s sixth president, rul-
ing from 1977 until he was assas-
sinated while in office in 1981.
The couple had two children, 
Tarique and Arafat. Arafat Rah-
man died of cardiac arrest in 
Malaysia in 2015, according to 
Bangladeshi media. Tarique Rah-
man, 60, the current BNP acting 
chairperson, returned to Bangla-
desh this month after 17 years in 
exile, ahead of elections sched-
uled for February.

a verification failure
The Dec. 25 Metro article “New 
U-Va. leader’s past DEI efforts draw 
conservative ire,” on Scott C. Beardsley’s 
revised curriculum vitae should be read 
as a presidential-search problem: a fail-
ure of basic verification.
For more than a decade, my research 
has examined how presidential searches 
are conducted, how candidates are vet-
ted and why some searches produce 
leaders who succeed while others lead to 
avoidable crises. The most consistent 
finding is that process matters. A search 
insulated from independent scrutiny in-
vites preventable error.
In well-designed searches, vetting is a 
discipline built into every stage — docu-
ment review, reference gathering and 
campus engagement — because the risks 
of a presidential appointment are high 
and long-lasting. Search firms can help 
coordinate that work, but they cannot 
substitute for the independent scrutiny 
that comes from a broadly constituted 
search committee and meaningful facul-
ty participation.
Faculty involvement is not symbolic; it 
is quality control. Faculty and senior staff 
know the institution’s public record, 
identify inconsistencies in language and 
claims and are more likely to ask the 
questions that an overly managed search 
is designed to avoid. They compare 
public materials across versions, test 
narratives against observable perfor-
mance and insist on explanations when 
something doesn’t add up.
The changes in Beardsley’s public CV 
are exactly the kind of discrepancy a 
serious search process would have sur-
faced immediately.
When a candidate’s documented re-
cord can be materially misrepresented 
during an active search without trigger-
ing inquiry, the problem is not the 
candidate’s editing. The problem is the 
search architecture.
Judith Wilde, Albuquerque
The writer is a research professor at 
George Mason University.
The Dec. 26 editorial “Socialized medi-
cine can’t survive the winter” criticized 
the United Kingdom’s National Health 
Service and falsely suggested that Brit-
ain’s system resembles Medicare-for-all, 
legislation that I have introduced in the 
Senate and which has 17 co-sponsors. 
That comparison is inaccurate and ob-
scures a more important truth: Many of 
the problems The Post attributed to the 
NHS are far more prevalent in the United 
States.
The Post describes the U.K. system as 
costly but conveniently ignored the fact 
that the United States spends far more on 
health care per capita than any major 
country on Earth — $14,885 per person 
each year — more than double what the 
United Kingdom, Canada and France 
spend.
The result: More than 27 million Amer-
icans are uninsured. About 1 in 4 have 
difficulty affording prescription drugs. 
And an estimated 500,000 people go 
bankrupt each year because of medical 
debt.
The Post also called the NHS ineffi-
cient. In reality, it’s the American health 
care system that is bureaucratic and 
wasteful.
Medicare-for-all is not a government-
run, British-style National Health Ser-
vice system. It is a government-funded 
universal insurance program. Medicare-
for-all would simply expand Medicare — 
a program that has worked extremely 
well for more than six decades — to cover 
every American, eliminate premiums 
and out-of-pocket costs, give people the 
freedom to choose their doctors, and 
ensure no one is denied care.
Every other major nation has figured 
out how to provide universal health care 
at far lower cost. The question is whether 
the United States will finally do the same.

what california’s 
task force found
In its Dec. 20 editorial “Wes Moore is 
right about reparations,” the Editorial 
Board called Maryland’s commission to 
study Black reparations “foolish” be-
cause it is “too complicated to ascertain 
whose ancestors wronged whom more 
than 150 years ago.”
The California Reparations Task Force, 
of which I was a member, found that 
though slavery “was our nation’s ‘original 
sin,’ emancipation did not bring an end 
to the atrocities and deprivations visited 
upon African Americans. Through lynch-
ing and other terror, including the Black 
Codes, Jim Crow laws, disenfranchise-
ment, segregation, discrimination, exclu-
sion, and neglect in every facet of life, 
government at all levels has perpetuated 
the legacy of slavery. African Americans 
as a group ... live with the persistent 
consequences of this legacy.”
The harms were not just the result of 
wrongs perpetrated by individuals 150 
years ago, they were the result of govern-
ment policies designed to systematically 
subjugate Black Americans.
The Post cited examples of individual 
Black success to dismiss even the study 
of reparations, but it ignored huge group 
disparities that persist. According to a 
2021 report from the National Associa-
tion of Realtors, Maryland’s Black home-
ownership rate is 52 percent while White 
ownership is 76 percent. And though 
Black people make up about 14 percent 
of the total population, they constitute 
nearly 40 percent of the federal prison 
population.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
N
NEW YORK’S crusade against 
gas stoves is being placed on the 
back burner: Gov. Kathy Hochul 
(D) recently delayed the imple-
mentation of a 2023 ban on running gas 
in new buildings before it took effect in 
January.
That hasn’t been Hochul’s only cli-
mate backtrack. In November, she 
agreed to a Trump-backed gas pipeline, 
marking the Empire State’s first pipeline 
in at least a decade — and the first since 
they passed their hallmark climate law 
in 2019 requiring the state to cut carbon 
emissions 40 percent by 2030. Hochul 
also signed an agreement granting per-
mits to a gas-powered crypto mining 
facility, on the condition the plant nearly 
halves its pollution by 2030.
When asked in October about the 
mandate for no gas in new buildings, the 
governor said she’s “going to look at this 
with a very realistic approach and do 
what I can, because my number one 
focus is affordability.” Hochul’s U-turn is 
an admission that the anti-energy agen-
da pushed by far-left environmental 
groups was always unaffordable.
Climate activists accuse Hochul of be-
ing a traitor, but maybe the governor has 
finally realized that there’s rarely any 
upside to pursuing unrealistic decarbon-
ization plans. At the very least, it looks like 
she’s paying attention to voters during a 
reelection cycle. Polling shows 61 percent 
of New Yorkers — including 54 percent of 
Democrats — “somewhat” or “strongly” 
agree that keeping energy affordable in 
the state is more important right now 
than reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The state’s residential electricity pric-
es have risen 36 percent since New York 
passed its decarbonization legislation in 
2019, according to a Progressive Policy 
Institute study. That’s almost three times 
faster than the rest of the country. Still, 
nearly half of New York’s electricity is 
supplied by fossil fuels. That study con-
cludes that New York’s energy strategy is 
driving up costs, constraining reliable 
supply and jeopardizing the political 
viability of the state’s climate agenda. 
Other blue states face similar pain.
It’s no coincidence that most of the 
states with the highest prices also have 
the most ambitious decarbonization 
mandates. Even though the federal gov-
ernment can dish out all kinds of subsi-
dies for renewable energy, the states 
largely get to regulate how they generate 
and sell their electricity.
Florida has chosen to base its energy 
generation on reliability and affordabili-
ty, instead of ideology. Despite intense 
energy demands driven by a subtropical 
climate, Florida’s electricity prices are 
two percent lower than the national 
average. The state gets about 75 percent 
of its energy from natural gas.
Symbolic climate gestures please ac-
tivists, but they become a political liabili-
ty when the bills come due.

the manager coughed up “an enhanced

Fortunately for New Yorkers, Lander 
appears to have been foiled — at least 
for now. The board of the New York City 
Employees’ Retirement System, one of 
the boards, voted at Lander’s final 
meeting on Dec. 17 to table his recom-
mendation until January. It’s a wel-
come signal that the fad of ESG invest-
ing (short for Environmental, Social 
and Governance) continues to fade.
BlackRock accused Lander of taking 
part in the “politicization of public

that “the systemic risk of the climate 
crisis threatens the long-term value of 
New York City’s pension funds.”

T
HE JOB OF pension fund man-
agers is to maximize returns for 
retirees who depend on them. 
Yet activists have been surpris-
ingly adept in years past at pushing 
funds to prioritize environmental activ-
ism over generating shareholder value. 
Brad Lander, soon to be New York City’s 
former comptroller, has used his final 
days in office to push that radical 
agenda at the expense of the people he 
is meant to serve.
A big part of Lander’s current job, 
which ends Wednesday, is serving as a 
trustee for the public pension funds 
that more than 750,000 city workers 
are counting on. But, with backing from 
Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Lander 
is now challenging Rep. Dan Goldman 
from the left in June’s Democratic 
primary.
Last month, Lander tried to bolster 
his climate bone fides — and give 
himself a signature campaign issue — 
when he called on the city’s pension 
boards to transfer billions in funds 
invested with BlackRock, Fidelity and 
PanAgora Asset Management to com-
peting firms that are more aggressive 
about “decarbonizing” their portfolios.
BlackRock oversees $42.3 billion in 
index funds for city pensions while 
leaned into ESG during a different 
political moment. But that changed 
after Texas passed a law blacklisting 
BlackRock for its fossil fuel “boycott,” 
and GOP state attorneys general ac-
cused it of manipulating energy mar-
kets with its ESG approach. In Febru-
ary, the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission issued guidance aimed at 
limiting the consideration of ESG 
factors when investing.
No doubt climate change will have an 
effect on markets for decades to come, 
but savvy asset managers will be able to 
address it without allowing nebulous 
climate goals to undermine their fidu-
ciary responsibilities. There’s a differ-
ence between prudent investment cal-
culations and political posturing.
Under New York’s previous comp-
troller, Scott Stringer, the city’s pension 
funds dropped $4 billion of invest-
ments in fossil fuel companies. Two 
years ago, Lander got three of the city’s 
five pension funds to adopt plans to 
zero out emissions from their portfolios 
by 2040. The police and firefighter 
pensions refused to go along.
This is part of a trend, from Albany to 
Brussels. After setting unrealistic net-
zero emissions goals, governments con-
tinue to recalibrate.

OHRAN MAMDANI will be 
sworn in as New York City’s may-
or just after the clock strikes mid-
night on New Year’s. The socialist 
has decided to take the oath of office 
during a private ceremony in the old City 
Hall subway station, which has been 
abandoned since 1945. The Gilded Age 
marvel features magnificent arches, col-
ored glass tiling, brass chandeliers and 
bronze plaques.
It’s an inspired choice, though not in 
the way he intends.
Mamdani explains that, when the 
station first opened in 1904, “it was a 
physical monument to a city that dared 
to be both beautiful and build great 
things that would transform working 
peoples’ lives.” He added in a statement 
that such “ambition need not be a mem-
ory confined only to our past.” He forgot 
to mention that this beautiful monu-
ment was a triumph of capitalism, not 
government.
The Interborough Rapid Transit Com-
pany was a private corporation from its 
founding in 1902 until its purchase by 
the city in 1940. The original IRT line, of 
which City Hall station was the crown 
jewel, ran 9.1 miles and included 27 other 
stations. It was built in four years and 
seven months at the equivalent cost of 
$1.2 billion in today’s money.
Compare this with the government’s 
risks worsening nearly every problem 
with the system. “Free” buses, which 
would actually cost New Yorkers about 
$800 million a year, will make them 
magnets for crime and vagrancy. That’s 
also what will happen to the subway if he 
moves ahead with his plan to repurpose 
vacant newsstands in the 100 busiest 
stations for homeless outreach centers, 
with the goal of providing “triage” for the 
mentally ill.
The incoming mayor is right that the 
Big Apple’s subway is a good “monu-
ment,” but it’s to what happens when 
government thinks it knows better than 
private firms. Those interested in the 
city’s flourishing should want more 
things to look like the private skyscrap-
ers above ground than the public transit 
below it.

A
merica’s scientific dominance was never 
inevitable; in the 1920s, serious PhDs went 
to Europe. World War II changed every-
thing. Afterward, the United States built an 
unmatched innovation ecosystem with massive fed-
eral investment in basic science coupled with risk-
tolerant capital markets to commercialize new dis-
coveries.
American policymakers grasped a crucial insight: 
They were investing in people, not just research. As 
scientists became strategic national assets, immi-
gration policy was redesigned to recruit them.
America’s advantage persists. But bureaucratic 
ossification now threatens it, as our global rivals 
pick off the best and brightest that we have trained 
but can’t retain — unless we change our visa system.
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing and Medicine warned last year that the 
U.S. lacks a “whole-of-government talent strategy” 
for science, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM). Though U.S. universities rank first globally 
on research quality, our visa system is among the 
slowest and least predictable in the developed 
world. Our talent policy assumes that top research-
ers will endure any visa lottery or processing delay 
to stay in the U.S. That assumption is obsolete.
Both our allies and our adversaries have created 
visa systems that are faster, simpler and more 
certain. China’s new K-visa targets young STEM 
talent, and its Qiming Program recruits top scien-
tists with $420,000 to $700,000 signing bonuses 
and full housing subsidies. Germany’s Opportunity 
Card allows skilled workers in before they find jobs. 
Britain’s High Potential Individual visa requires no 
job offer, just a top university degree. Japan’s J-Find 
gives recent PhD graduates two years to job-hunt or 
launch companies. And there are more.
Open Doors, an annual survey tracking interna-
tional student enrollment in the U.S., reports signif-
icant growth in international PhD enrollment (up 
25 percent over the past decade). Yet the Organiza-
tion for Economic and Commercial Development’s 
2023 Talent Attractiveness indicators ranked the 
United States eighth among OECD countries for 
highly skilled workers but note that it would have 
ranked second if not for its visa policies. Competi-
tors have noticed and are happy to accept the talent 
we train but fail to keep.
Case in point: Between 2017 and 2021, Canada 
issued permanent residency invitations to about 
45,000 U.S.-educated graduates, according to a Nis-
kanen Center analysis. This outflow is roughly equiv-
alent to losing the combined graduating classes of 
MIT, Stanford and Caltech every year for five years.
Presidents have the authority to modernize as-
pects of the U.S. visa system. Here’s what President 
Donald Trump could do:
First, update Schedule A, the Labor Department’s 
list of shortage occupations that fast-track green 
cards. Largely unchanged since the 1990s, it should 
immediately include artificial intelligence and ma-
chine learning researchers, quantum computing 
scientists and semiconductor engineers — and es-
tablish a data-driven process for regular updates. 
Adding these fields cuts red tape and provides the 
predictability necessary to recruit top scientists.
Second, unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and 
entrepreneurs. Britain and Singapore offer dedicat-
ed “founder tracks.” America can match this: Direct 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to recog-
nize citation metrics and venture capital backing as 
“extraordinary ability.” This visa is uncapped yet 
underused (only about 4,500 STEM approvals in 
2023). The bottleneck is how narrowly we define 
who counts as “extraordinary.” Academic journals 
and private capital markets efficiently identify 
breakthrough talent. Clearer guidance would un-
lock the category for scientists creating knowledge 
and founders building companies.
Third, establish a presumption of eligibility for 
National Interest Waivers for U.S.-trained STEM 
PhDs — a reform with bipartisan backing. This uses 
existing authority to retain research university grad-
uates who are most critical to our industrial base. 
Many PhD graduates leave as green card backlogs 
prevent them from starting companies, changing 
jobs freely or establishing long-term security for 
their families.
Finally, allow renewable STEM OPT extensions for 
high earners in Schedule A fields with salaries above 
the 75th percentile in the industry, or at prevailing 
institutional rates for research positions at universi-
ties. These renewable periods create stable pathways 
for high-value talent while scientists navigate estab-
lishing permanent residency. This regulatory cer-
tainty would counter British and Canadian offers 
that scientists accept while facing H-1B lottery uncer-
tainty and 12- to 18-month processing delays.
Critics may argue that these actions threaten 
American workers. But the policies target PhD hold-
ers in STEM fields with documented domestic short-
ages. Georgetown University’s workforce projections 
show that the U.S. needs 4.5 million additional 
workers with bachelor’s degrees or higher through 
2032, with acute shortages in engineering, computer 
and mathematical occupations, and health care.
The choice isn’t between domestic and foreign 
talent; the nation was built on both. Investing in 
domestic STEM education is essential. But building 
homegrown capacity takes years. China graduated 
3.57 million STEM students in 2020; the U.S. gradu-
ated 820,000. Closing that gap domestically would 
require quadrupling university STEM capacity and 
reversing current demographic trends.
America’s post-World War II scientific leadership 
emerged from a powerful ecosystem that recruited 
the world’s best minds. But our current visa system, 
built for 1990s labor markets, obstructs rather than 
accelerates growth.
Great presidents are remembered for the infra-
structure they build. President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower’s Interstate Highway System unlocked com-
merce and opportunity on a large scale. President 
Trump can secure a different kind of infrastructure 
legacy: a talent pipeline that will power American 
innovation for generations to come.

T
his holiday season, police departments 
across the country will repeat their laudable 
annual efforts to deter drunken driving. Yet 
more than a decade after states began 
legalizing recreational marijuana, or cannabis, effec-
tive policies to counter driving while high on it don’t 
exist. There are several reasons why the danger from 
cannabis-impaired drivers has so far gone largely 
unaddressed, and why the threat is increasing.
The first challenge is that when police stop a 
driver suspected of driving under the influence, they 
have no equivalent of a roadside breathalyzer test for 
detecting cannabis intoxication. There is no widely 
agreed-upon, valid standard for rapidly and accu-
rately measuring the amount of THC — cannabis’s 
psychoactive agent — in a person’s body. Even taking 
a suspected THC-intoxicated driver to the police 
station for a blood or urine test would be pointless: 
THC is lipophilic, meaning it hangs around in fat 
cells long after it has been consumed. That can skew 
testing, producing a positive result in a blood or 
urine test even though the person who consumed the 
cannabis is no longer high.
The second challenge: Getting high has become 
incredibly cheap in some states. For example, the 
median retail price for a gram of cannabis flower in 
Oregon is now $3.33 — about a 70 percent drop since 
2016. It used to be the case that a gram would make 
about three joints, but these days it’s common to see 
one-gram pre-rolled joints in dispensaries. Some 
stores in Michigan have advertised ounces for 
$25, which, including taxes, works out to about 
$1 per gram.
Third, policymakers and advocates in many states 
did not follow up marijuana legalization with ade-
quate regulations for the industry they created, the 
higher-potency products it produced or the aggres-
siveness or accuracy with which those products were 
marketed. How states would detect and deter canna-
bis-impaired driving is one of many policy problems 
that did not receive sufficient thought.
The consequences are easy to see. A 2024 survey 
indicated that at least 11.7 million people in the 
United States had driven under the influence of 
cannabis in the prior year. That’s not far below the 
14.2 million estimated to have driven under the 
influence of alcohol. Another national study found 
that in the month before being surveyed, 13 percent 
of high-school student drivers had driven when they 
had been using cannabis.
The lore persists in some circles that cannabis 
makes people safer drivers because they drive slower. 
Whether this was true in the era of weak weed that 
averaged 5 percent THC, it is clearly not true today, 
when the average flower sold in legal markets is closer 
to 20 percent THC, and concentrated products typi-
cally range between 60 and 90 percent THC. The 
resulting driving impairment is generally not as bad 
as that of alcohol, but still raises the risk of traffic 
crashes. And when someone drives both drunk and 
stoned, it can amplify the risk even further.
What could be done?
Multiple measurement technologies including oral 
swabs, urine screens and behavioral tests are being 
developed to better measure cannabis impairment, 
but none is yet as valid and simple to use as an alcohol 
breathalyzer. This would be an excellent target for 
incentivizing a “breakthrough prize” from the govern-
ment. A public-private partnership might help arrive 
at an answer more urgently. Cities might also experi-
ment with increasing the availability of driverless-car 
technology to reduce impaired driving of all sorts.
But possible solutions extend beyond technologi-
cal fixes.
Mass media campaigns to discourage people from 
driving after consuming cannabis — or riding in 
vehicles with these drivers — seem appropriate, 
especially since an expert panel concluded that 
“well-funded media campaigns are an important 
component of alcohol-impaired driving enforcement 
policy interventions.” Indeed, a recent National 
Academies report on cannabis policy and public 
health called on the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to help develop and evaluate education 
campaigns.
Alcohol offers other lessons. For example, in the 
24/7 Sobriety program used in several states, an 
individual with multiple impaired driving arrests has 
their right to use alcohol at any time suspended. The 
penalty is enforced with frequent testing and immedi-
ate sanctions after a positive test. Jurisdictions could 
pilot and evaluate 24/7 Sobriety programs focused on 
cannabis, and possibly augment them to incorporate 
positive incentives for compliance.
Also, mandating a floor price for alcohol has been 
shown to reduce alcohol use by heavy drinkers while 
little affecting moderate drinkers. Because cannabis 
sellers profit by encouraging and maintaining heavy 
use, imposing adequate regulation and counteract-
ing large price decreases (for instance, with mini-
mum unit pricing) could have the side effect of 
making the roads safer.
A key challenge will be to generate political 
interest in the hard work of writing and enforcing 
the regulations needed to make our roads and 
highways safer. Congress recently took the step of 
closing the “intoxicating hemp loophole,” which had 
created a large THC industry particularly in states 
without legal cannabis. Perhaps this is a harbinger, 
and more policymakers will begin taking cannabis 
regulation seriously. The benefits of doing so would 
be significant for road safety as well as for public 
health more generally.

A
s No. 1 seed Indiana prepares to face No. 9 
Alabama in the Rose Bowl on Thursday, 
the Hoosiers are focusing on coach Curt 
Cignetti’s mantra that drove the team’s 
remarkable rise to the top in college football this 
year: Fast. Physical. Relentless.
It’s a standard defined by a clear vision, prepara-
tion and results — attributes that universities 
striving for success would do well to embrace. 
Public confidence in higher education has risen 
modestly from its recent low of 36 percent, but the 
measure remains far below the 57 percent recorded 
just 10 years ago. Many Americans continue to 
question whether universities are still capable of 
delivering on their core promises.
The best answer will come from institutions 
willing to prepare rigorously, execute decisively 
and measure themselves by results, as I work to do 
at Indiana University, the institution I lead. The 
goal for administrations in higher education must 
not be to reclaim trust for our own sake, but for 
how we drive talent and innovation to help solve 
tomorrow’s pressing problems and power the next 
decade of American ingenuity.
The headwinds are real. State budgets are 
constrained. Federal policymakers are making 
sweeping changes to how research grants are 
structured and awarded. And there are clear limits 
to what students and families are willing to pay in 
tuition and fees even as the pool of traditional 
college-going students is declining.
Recent decades offer examples of some of 
America’s most competitive companies facing 
similar moments of constraint and pressure, from 
postrecession General Motors to post-DVD Netf-
lix. They emerged stronger by prioritizing perfor-
mance in a new environment, without sacrificing 
ties to tradition.
Similar dynamics have played out at a small 
number of public universities, such as Georgia 
Tech and Arizona State, that have focused on 
streamlining and relevance to engage more direct-
ly with industry, establish reputations for innova-
tion and deliver greater access at scale — increas-
ing trust even amid disruption.
Universities that flourish in the coming years 
will see opportunity in this moment, not because 
they’re blind to the challenges but because they 
refuse to be paralyzed by the uncertainty.
Execution is ultimately a matter of culture. On 
the football field, success is rarely about a single 
play or star athlete — even one as hardworking and 
talented as Hoosier quarterback Fernando Mendo-
za, Indiana’s first Heisman Trophy winner. Instead, 
it’s about daily preparation and accountability. The 
same is true in higher education. Institutions that 
succeed will be those that build cultures where 
vision is matched by follow-through, and where 
performance is measured consistently and ac-
countability is embedded in daily practice.
The best institutions will seek and generate 
investment that creates returns not just for the 
university, but also for the communities they serve. 
At Indiana University, that includes $138 million 
from the Lilly Endowment to create the IU Launch 
Accelerator for Biosciences, a bet on our ability to 
engage entrepreneurs and other partners to accel-
erate research initiatives that yield new cures and 
treatments. The test of such investments will 
ultimately be whether they effectively shrink the 
period from discovery to deployment.
Universities that succeed will unapologetically 
place a priority on student needs. They will align 
degree offerings with student demand. At IU, that 
means hard choices about consolidating low -
enrolling degree programs — some with proud 
histories — while launching new offerings in 
microelectronics, business intelligence and data 
science, bioengineering and more. Universities 
should also ensure that graduates have been 
prepared for the workplace. That includes foster-
ing creativity and judgment while teaching stu-
dents to use technology such as artificial intelli-
gence effectively and responsibly.
At the same time, the strongest educational 
institutions will become truly nimble research and 
workforce partners to industry, breaking down 
long-standing bureaucratic barriers and fostering 
productive collaboration that drives alignment 
with critical industries. Industry is — Cignetti-style 
— fast and relentless, with little patience for 
plodding timelines or duplicative processes. Uni-
versities must adapt accordingly.
Of course, public universities must also meet 
this fiscal moment, prioritizing affordability for 
students and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.
And finally, the institutions that thrive will be 
clear-eyed about the rapid evolution in collegiate 
athletics. Alignment between university leadership 
and athletics has arguably never been more impor-
tant. We must look past escalating spending and 
headlines to drive disciplined strategy that yields 
not only on-field success and alumni pride but 
coherence with our broader academic mission.
I see Indiana University as an institution work-

Stocks fall heading 
into new year
 Stocks fell slightly Tuesday on 
Wall Street  as trading for 2025 
nudges closer to the finish line. 
With one trading day left 
before the year ends, most big 
investors have closed out their 
positions and volume has been 
thin. Every major index is 
headed for a double-digit gain 
for the year.
The S&P 500 fell 9.5 points, or 
0.1 percent, to 6,894.24. Even 
with three straight days of small 
losses, the S&P 500 is on track 
for an annual gain of more than 
17 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average fell 94.87 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 48,367.06. The 
Nasdaq composite index fell 
55.27 points, or 0.2 percent, to 
23,419.08. 
The biggest weights on the 
market remained technology 
companies, especially those 
focused on advancements for 
artificial intelligence.
Treasury yields were mixed in 
the bond market. The yield on 
the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.12 
percent from 4.11 percent late 
Monday. The yield on the two-
year Treasury, which moves more 
closely with expectations for 
what the Federal Reserve will do, 
held steady at 3.45 percent from 
late Monday.
Overall, Treasury yields have 
fallen significantly through the 
year, partly because of the 
market’s expectations for a shift 
in interest rate policy at the Fed. 
The central bank cut interest 
rates three times late in 2025, 
most recently at its meeting in 
December.
Nvidia fell 0.4 percent, and 
Apple fell 0.2 percent. Both 
companies have outsize values 
that have a greater overall 
impact on the market’s broader 
direction.
Inflation remains stubbornly 
high while the jobs market slows 
down. The Fed can cut interest 
rates to help the economy 
weather a slower jobs market. 
But that could add more fuel to 
inflation that is still solidly above 
the Fed’s 2 percent target. Hotter 
inflation could stunt economic 
growth.
U.S. markets will be closed 
Thursday for New Year’s Day.

Undersea tunnel 
service interrupted
Power problems and a stuck 
train interrupted rail services 
through the undersea Channel 
Tunnel connecting the United 
Kingdom and continental 
Europe on Tuesday, operators 
said, stranding passengers 
during the busy end-of-year 
holidays. 
Eurostar blamed “overhead 
power supply issues in the 
Channel Tunnel” and a failure 
aboard a train operated by 
LeShuttle.
On Tuesday afternoon, 
Eurostar said the tunnel was 
partially reopening but with only 
one of its two train lines, 
allowing Eurostar services to 
resume in the evening — 
although with expected delays 
and longer journey times than

Meta buys platform 
based in Singapore
Meta is buying artificial 
intelligence start-up Manus, as 
the owner of Facebook and 
Instagram continues an 
aggressive push to amp up AI 
offerings across its platforms. 
 The California tech giant 
declined to disclose financial 
details of the acquisition, but the 
Wall Street Journal reported that 
Meta closed the deal at more 
than $2 billion. 
Manus, a Singapore-based 
platform with some Chinese 
roots, launched its first “general-
purpose” AI agent earlier this 
year. 
A Meta spokesperson 
confirmed on Tuesday that the 
platform would also discontinue 
its services and operations in 
China. Manus reiterated that it 
would continue to operate in 
Singapore, where most of its 
employees are based.

I
t’s my annual tradition to take 
stock of big themes in tech-
nology, with a focus on posi-
tive developments for you in the 
past year. Here is the tally of the 
mostly good, but occasionally 
crummy, year in technology for 
2025.
AI that’s useful and 
less creepy
I love the motto of Gabriel 
Weinberg, the CEO of the web 
search and browser company 
DuckDuckGo: AI should be “use-
ful, private, and optional.”
DuckDuckGo lets you access 
chatbots including ChatGPT but 
insists that the AI companies 
can’t access your data. (The 
Washington Post has a content 
partnership with ChatGPT own-
er OpenAI.)
You can turn off AI features in 
DuckDuckGo, too. I’m hoping 
that DuckDuckGo inspires more 
AI kill switches across the inter-
net.
I’m declaring DuckDuckGo 
the best technology company of 
2025. Even if you never use its 
products, DuckDuckGo shows 
that people and companies can 
challenge the Silicon Valley con-
ventional wisdom that AI is inev-
itable, inescapable and insatia-
ble.
I’m also curious about the 
just-announced encrypted chat-
bot from Moxie Marlinspike.
I haven’t tried it yet, but 
Marlinspike helped create the 
gold standard encryption that’s 
used by the Signal app, What-
sApp, Meta Messenger and 
Google’s texting app for An-
droid phones. If he can likewise 
establish a usable, private chat-
bot standard, that’s a boon for 
you.
And I never thought I’d say 
this, but I’m a convert to AI 
search technologies for questions 
and research that don’t work in 
standard web searches.
I asked ChatGPT recently for 
the Stephen King novel featuring 
a character that carves into the 
skin of another. (“It.”) I used 
Google’s AI Mode to poke into 
technology stock returns since 
the 2010s. It wasn’t perfect, but it 
was useful to guide more inten-
sive research.
Using AI search tools isn’t 
life-changing. And AI still has the 
same problems. It risks draining 
precious resources, preying on 
vulnerable minds, wiping out 
jobs or choking your favorite 
websites.
The worst technology of 2025 
is a no-brainer: AI “agents,” the 
chatbots or AI browsers that 
promised you could just tell AI 
what to do — order groceries or 
find the best mattress. Outside a 
handful of tasks such as software 
coding, agents are an overhyped 
mess. 
It became glaring this year 
that many Americans mistrust, 
reject or feel pessimistic about AI 
even as we use the technology 
more. That’s not a contradiction. 
It’s a warning sign.
The companies that make AI, 
and those of us who use it, must 
focus on judicious deployment of 
AI. We can insist that AI be 
useful, private, optional and 
open about its shortcomings. 
And we must be clear-eyed about 
when AI is the wrong tool for the 
job.
A technology that beat 
inflation and got cheaper
Government inflation figures 
show that prices of wireless 
phone service have fallen this 
year. It shows that corporate 
warfare can actually help you.
Mobile phone carriers are in-
creasingly fighting one another 
for customers. That has show-
ered many people with steeply 
discounted new smartphones. 
There’s also a flourishing market 
for alternative mobile service 
providers that can save you loads 
of money. 
The bad news: You can proba-
bly expect price increases in 2026 
for laptops and some other elec-
tronics. Blame AI.
Gen Z protests and 
government workers 
showed technology’s 
empowering promise
In the United States, federal 
government workers who were 
stunned by the tumultuous start 
to the second Trump administra-
tion swarmed to Signal and Red-
dit to discuss what was happen-
ing, buck each other up and share 
their experiences.
And in countries such as Nepal 
and Indonesia, young people dis-
appointed in their political lead-
ers used apps such as TikTok, 
Discord and WhatsApp to spread 
memes, organize protests and 
even appoint new political lead-
ers.
These twin movements felt 
like an echo of the Arab Spring. 
Those early 2010s uprisings 
helped cement the idea that peo-
ple could harness social media to 
unite against entrenched power.
As with the Arab Spring, 
2025’s technology-aided move-
ments might not bring lasting 
change. But they did remind us of 
technology’s promise to empow-
er the little guys.
The most important 
technology of 2025 is …
YouTube. It’s the place to un-
derstand where our culture, tech-
nology and media are headed.
Google-owned YouTube re-
mains America’s most popular 
social media service among 
adults and teens. It tops Face-
book, TikTok and Instagram by a 
country mile.
Americans also spend more 
time watching YouTube on TV 
than anything else. Netflix is a 
distant second, according to 
Nielsen.
YouTube has spawned news 
and entertainment empires that 
couldn’t have existed before, in-
cluding MrBeast and Ms. Rachel. 
It’s also increasingly the home 
for big events such as football 
games and the Oscars. That com-
bination has grabbed your time, 
advertisers’ dollars and cultural 
influence away from traditional 
Hollywood and media gatekeep-
ers.
That makes YouTube the most 
consequential technology in our 
lives and — with apologies to 
Netflix and the Ellison family — 
the most disruptive force in me-
dia and entertainment.
Runner 
up: 
Smartphones. 
There will be more attempts in 
2026 at AI-dedicated smart glass-
es and other gadgets intended to 
displace the smartphone as the 
primary computer for billions of 
people. But it may be that the 
killer AI device is still the smart-
phone.

Home builders thought this 
year was going to bring a boom. 
They were wrong.
Single-family 
construction 
starts — a crucial measure of how 
many new homes are being built 
— are expected to come in 7 
percent lower in 2025 than last 
year, according to forecasts from 
the National Association of Home 
Builders. Among new homes built 
for rent, starts were down 16 
percent in mid-2025 compared to 
the year before. Home builders 
are offering more and more perks 
to get buyers off the sidelines, and 
a closely watched sentiment sur-
vey showed builders stayed glum 
throughout the year.
“The expectations for 2025 
were better than the actual re-
sults,” said Robert Dietz, chief 
economist at NAHB. Some data 
won’t be complete until early next 
year. But big-picture, the indus-
try’s hopes were “leaning too far 
into some of the optimism that we 
saw building in 2024.”
Indeed, last year ended on a 
relatively high note. Single-family 
starts in 2024 totaled 1.01 million, 
up 6.5 percent from 2023, accord-
ing to NAHB. Hundreds of thou-
sands of homes that started con-
struction on the heels of the pan-
demic hit the market last year, 
giving buyers and renters more 
options. And even though prices 
still ticked higher, the sense 
among many builders, housing 
economists and real estate agents 
was that 2025 — and in particular, 
President Donald Trump’s return 
to the White House — would 
usher in more momentum.
Many builders hoped the new 
administration would cut a slew 
of environmental and permitting 
regulations that can slow con-
struction. They also expected 
broader economic growth and 
that, as inflation simmered down, 
the Federal Reserve would keep 
lowering interest rates, which in 
turn would help lower mortgage 
rates for buyers.
The U.S. economy did grow at 
its fastest pace in two years in the 
third quarter. But many of those 
other hopes haven’t materialized.
One key regulation — which 
prohibits building homes near 
water or roadside drainage ditch-
es that connect to creeks and 
streams without first obtaining a 
federal wetlands permit — hasn’t 
been updated yet. And while the 
Fed trimmed its benchmark rate 
three times this year, officials are 
increasingly split over how to 
respond to stubborn inflation 
and a softening labor market. For 
now, they only have one cut pen-
ciled in next year, which may not 
do much to nudge mortgage rates 
down. Last week, the 30-year 
fixed rate mortgage averaged 6.18 
percent, according to Freddie 
Mac, down from 6.85 percent this 
time last year.
Trump’s policies are weighing 
on builders, too. Sixty percent of 
builders say that their suppliers 
have already raised prices for 
materials, or that they will, be-
cause of tariffs, according to 
NAHB surveys. And across the 
country, the administration’s im-
migration crackdown has result-
ed in mass detentions and depor-
tations of foreign-born workers, a 
population that makes up about a 
third of the construction work-
force. There isn’t precise data on 
how many workers have been 
deported. But contracting and 
construction trade groups have 
long been worried about work-
place raids and random pickups, 
coaching employers on what to 
do if immigration officials show 
up at a site or start inquiring 
about paperwork.
In the Orlando area, Hardwick 
General Contracting had a full 
slate of projects to stay busy, said 
president and owner Greg Hard-
wick. But the ripple effects from a 
weakening job market, immigra-
tion policies and tariffs kept pop-
ping up. To keep construction on 
track, Hardwick said, he’s leaning 
more into subcontracting on larg-
er businesses that employ dozens 
or hundreds of people, rather 
than hiring smaller mom-and-
pop shops that can have a harder 
time filling vacancies. Still, he’s 
gotten calls this year letting him 
know drywall or stucco crews 
wouldn’t be able to show up be-
cause they were down too many 
workers, possibly because some 
had been detained or were too 
afraid to come to work, he said.
Hardwick also said suppliers 
were constantly reaching out 
about price increases — but with-
out clear explanations.
“We were getting letters from 
suppliers that tariffs were in-
creasing prices, but if you would 
call with a question and say, 
‘What specific tariff was increas-
ing the pricing here?’ they really 
couldn’t tie it to anything,” he 
said. “It was really the anticipa-
tion.”
Near Denver, high borrowing 
costs are the biggest hurdle for 
Jeff Jacob. Construction loans 
can hover one percentage point 
higher than regular 30-year 
loans. And at more than 7 per-
cent, Jacob said his rates are well 
above what he could secure from 
2017 to just a few years ago.
About half of his buyers pur-
chase homes in all cash, Jacob 
said, and he just finished the 
largest house he’s ever built. But 
the president of Jacob Custom 
Homes also sees the ways Colora-
do’s market responds to interest 
rates. One client put off a project 
because an old house hadn’t sold. 
Jacob has also stopped building 
homes that don’t have buyers 
lined up because demand is so 
low.
“I’ve been in this business for 
30 years. I’ve seen it go up and 
down,” Jacob said. “And always, 
always, always, the one big factor 
is always interest rates.”
Builders did see some bright 
spots. Construction for town-
houses — which are often more 
affordable for first-time buyers — 
is growing, with newly built 
townhouses accounting for more 
than 18 percent of all single-fami-
ly starts for the second quarter, 
according to NAHB. Custom 
home building — where a house is 
built on a lot owned by the owner, 
not the builder — was up 4 per-
cent in the second quarter com-
pared to 2024. Wealthier custom-
ers who are less sensitive to inter-
est rates and have more wealth in 
the stock market may account for 
that rise, Dietz said.
There’s also hope for more mo-
mentum in 2026. Existing-home 
sales are expected to clinch a 
small but meaningful gain over 
2025, rising about 1.7 percent, to 
4.13 million, according to Real-
tor.com. The number of homes 
for sale could also rise nearly 9 
percent year over year. And while 
mortgage rates aren’t expected to 
fall much, more construction will 
give buyers more options, which 
could help lower prices and drive 
sales. The Mortgage Bankers As-
sociation expects total single-
family mortgage origination vol-
ume to rise to $2.2 trillion in 
2026, up from the $2 trillion 
forecast for 2025.
New construction is giving 
breathing room to places like 
Nashville, where home values 
were up 45 percent in November 
compared to right before the pan-
demic, per Zillow data. Ashley 
Luther, a local real estate agent, 
said builders have been so eager 
to turn over properties that 
they’re keeping incentives for 
buyers flowing, at times even 
offering temporary buydowns 
that could take a mortgage rate as 
low as 4.99 percent. In a surpris-
ing twist, that has meant new 
homes are sometimes cheaper 
than existing ones, helping lure 
skeptical buyers back into the 
market.
“Buyers are just not confident 
in where our economy is headed,” 
said Luther, owner and broker of 
CHORD Real Estate. “And that 
gives them pause.”
Home builders hoped for a  2025 boom. It didn’t happen.

Two more artistic groups an-
nounced that they have canceled
upcoming
performances
at
the
Kennedy Center, adding to a grow-
ing list of acts that have chosen not
to perform at the storied institu-
tion after its board of directors
announced earlier this month that
it would add President Donald
Trump’s name to the venue.
Jazz supergroup the Cookers,
scheduled to perform two concerts
at the Kennedy Center on Wednes-
day as part of “A Jazz new Year’s
eve,” have canceled both shows, the
band announced on Monday. Doug
Varone and Dancers, a decades-old
performance group, also said on
Monday that they had decided to
cancel two performances sched-
uled for April.
“While we totally disagreed with
the takeover by the Trump Admin-
istration at the Kennedy Center, we
still believed it was important to
honor our engagement out of re-
spect for both Jane Raleigh and
Alicia Adams, who curated a first-
rate dance season, as well as for the

company said on social media,

longer with the institution. “How-

The Kennedy Center adopted by-
laws earlier this year that limited
voting to presidentially appointed
trustees, a move that preceded a
unanimous decision this month by
board members installed by Presi-
dent Donald Trump to add his name
to the center.
The current bylaws, obtained by
The Washington Post, were revised
in May to specify that board mem-
bers designated by Congress —
known as ex officio members —
could not vote or count toward a
quorum. Legal experts say the move
may conflict with the institution’s
charter.
Trump took over the Kennedy
Center in February, purging its
board of members he had not ap-
pointed. The months that followed
saw struggling ticket sales and pro-
gramming changes that began to
align the arts complex with the
Trump
administration’s
broader
cultural aims, culminating with the
annual Kennedy Center Honors
hosted by the president.
Days later, on Dec. 18, the board
voted to add the president’s name to
the institution, and within 24 hours
it was on the website and the build-

secretary C.J. Cregg
(Allison Janney) exults
when a contender for the
presidency flubs the all-important
question: Why do you want to be
president? Yet moments after C.J.
finishes gloating, she realizes that her
boss, the sitting president, may not have
a better answer. When she anxiously
questions President Josiah “Jed” Bartlet
(Martin Sheen) about his motivations,
he shrugs her off. “I’ve been thinking
about it for the last couple of hours,” he
tells her. “I almost had it.” A beat passes,
and the episode ends. By the time the
next one begins, Bartlet’s nonresponse is
long forgotten. The bustling denizens of
“The West Wing” are too consumed by
the crises of the hour to note that their
employer has failed to answer the
guiding question of his political career.
Almost a quarter-century after Bartlet
failed to justify his presidential
ambitions to C.J., “The West Wing”
occupies a curious place in the American
imagination. It is remembered as the
premier liberal artwork of the early
aughts and touted as a nostalgic relic —
an endearingly utopian artifact of a
softer, purer time. If its fusillades of
rapid-fire dialogue and its famed walk-
and-talk shots of characters in motion
remain as propulsive as ever, its political
outlook is canonized as
anachronistically earnest. “‘The West
Wing’ was also a full-throated argument
(perhaps too full-throated) for the
essential goodness of government and a
celebration of the talented people who
fill its ranks,” Ian Crouch wrote in the
new Yorker in 2012. In the episode
“Bartlet’s America,” the new York
Times’s James Poniewozik wrote in a
thoughtful reappraisal last year, “voters
reward you for fighting lies and
fearmongering with facts and reason.
Good intentions and great oratory win
the day. Well-meaning people reach
across the aisle and reason with their
colleagues. Politics is an earnest battle of
ideas, not a consuming war of all against
all.”
But “The West Wing” is a vastly more
cynical show than many of its admirers
remember, which is why it is also a more
compelling work of art than many of its
skeptics assume. It is not, in fact, a
paean to good government and the
dedication of White House bureaucrats,
nor is it an homage to good-faith debate
or a portrait of political rationality.

You write that your husband 
won’t help you. If you want him 
to compel his daughter to accept 
your apology, that might not 
actually be useful. Unfortunately, 
even though your relationship 
with the grandkids was, perhaps, 
healthy, the other relationships 
supporting it are less so.
So, what can you change? 
Well, you’re doing the most 
important first step by working 
on yourself in therapy. If your 
husband won’t go to couples 
counseling (which he should), 
ask him why and ask him how he 
proposes to help you both 
communicate better.

Since the beginning of our 
relationship, I have made every 
effort to be loving and generous 
to his daughter. She acts entitled 
and ungrateful to me.
It’s my fault for not standing 
up for myself early in my joining 
the family. for example, I wish to 
be thanked for gifts, babysitting, 
making holidays happen, having 
them over for dinner and so on.
She doesn’t seem to care about 
me at all. Her father will not 
stand up to her and seems scared 
of her.
Last summer I blew up at her 
in a text and let her know how I 
feel about her behavior.
I called her a manipulative 
user and let her know my truth, 
which is certainly not her truth. I 
apologized twice in two letters 
for being so harsh, but she will 
not forgive me, allow a repair or

If you have a desire to close 
this loop, you can reach out to 
martha one-on-one. Try saying 
something like: “I wanted to talk 
to you about what happened at 
the poker game the other day. 
Could you tell me more about 
what was frustrating you?”
You may not feel compelled to 
change the way the group plays 
just to suit her. But what she says 
can give you more insight, and 
with that insight you can decide 
on the best path forward for your 
friendship. It may be that she’s 
had enough of the poker group, 
and so it’s just not a good match 
anymore.

that?
I stopped inviting her; no 
apology, no remorse from her. 
She always tended to put me 
down. I can endure that, but 
putting my guests and my

they have perfected a politics of 
placation. Despite their nominal 
values, they spend their days 
managing and mollifying the 
public.
“The West Wing” aired from 
1999 to 2006, and there is good 
reason to believe that it inspired 
a generation of influential pun-
dits, a cohort that Vanity fair 
dubbed the “West Wing Babies” 
in 2012. Its orientation no doubt 
colored the tenor of the obama 
administration and the subse-
quent Democratic Party, encour-
aging campaigns to focus less on 
policy and more on public rela-
tions. There are many reasons 
the Biden-Harris campaign went 
up in flames, but one of them is 
surely its air of knowing better 
without deigning to articulate 
exactly what it knew.
What, in the end, are the actu-
al politic commitments of the 
Bartlet administration? What are 
its signature policies? Beyond its 
embrace of polite platitudes and 
its veneration for norms, beyond 
its reverence for civility and its 
penchant for symbolic displays 
of bipartisanship, does it have a 
vision? It would be too generous 
to describe Bartlet even as an ad-
vocate of efficiency, since there is 
nothing in particular he cares to 
be efficient about. His is a poli-
tics of folksy charisma and, 
above all, of winning — of saying 
whatever is likely to poll well on 
any given occasion and leaving 
the rest to the experts.
Just after 9/11, that was 
enough; it was presented and in-
terpreted as aspirational. But if 
rewatching “The West Wing” in 
our debased era teaches us any-
thing, it’s that we have come to 
demand more from our politi-
cians in the intervening decades. 
What struck contemporary view-
ers as utopian — and subsequent 
commentators as nostalgic — 
now strikes us tellingly vacant; 
what once seemed like bipartisan 
flexibility now looks like squishy 
evasion. In 2026, a more definite 
answer to C.J.’s question is re-
quired.
without much outrage; it turns 
out Sam was wrong to worry.)
But it is C.J., the face of the ad-
ministration, who is most often 
tasked with defending policies 
she despises. She is the one who 
escorts Native American protest-
ers out of the White House lobby, 
even though she finds herself in-
dignant on their behalf; she is 
the one who talks the parents of 
a murdered gay man out of criti-
cizing Bartlet’s inadequate gay 
rights policies in public, even 
though she ultimately regards 
their complaint as righteous. 
When the administration makes 
an arms deal with Qumar, a fic-
tional stand-in for Saudi Arabia, 
C.J. stands at the lectern, smiling 
and quipping through her feeble 
excuses. Behind the scenes, she 
fumes.
Though C.J. finds herself ratio-
nalizing Bartlet’s failures more 
often than her colleagues do, all 
of the show’s main characters are 
called upon to manage their am-
bivalence when they discover 
that the president has multiple 
sclerosis, a diagnosis that he con-
cealed from the public through-
out his campaign and tenure in 
office. His staff is outraged by the 
cover-up — Toby denounces it as 
a “deception of massive propor-
tion” — but, ultimately, everyone 
chokes back their reservations 
and helps the administration 
navigate the inevitable fallout.
It isn’t that the wonks of “The 
West Wing” are villainous. on 
the contrary, they are winningly 
dedicated and endearingly well-
intentioned. They also happen to 
be calculating and scheming, as 
their jobs often oblige them to 
be. At their best, they are bruised 
idealists; at their worst, they are 
jaded operators. In short, they 
are believably conflicted and in-
consistent — and therefore inter-
esting. Their tragedy consists in 
the ease with which their princi-
ples are compromised by the 
pressures of the job. They joined 
the Bartlet campaign because of 
their egalitarian aspirations, but 
several years into his presidency, 
rather, it is an honest and often 
quietly wrenching exploration of 
the machiavellian maneuvering 
that corrupts even the most well-
meaning people in politics.
The show’s main protagonists 
— Cregg, Communications Direc-
tor Toby Ziegler (richard Schiff), 
Deputy Communications Direc-
tor and speechwriter Sam 
Seaborn (rob Lowe), Chief of 
Staff Leo mcGarry (John Spen-
cer), Deputy Chief of Staff Josh 
Lyman (Bradley Whitford) and 
President Bartlet — spend most 
of the show fretting over Pr di-
sasters and comparatively little 
time worrying about matters of 
political substance. In the epi-
sode after Bartlet brushes C.J. 
off, Sam tries to persuade an offi-
cial from the office of manage-
ment and Budget to recalibrate 
the poverty index — not because 
he believes that the agency’s cal-
culations are wrong but because 
the new measure would deem an 
additional 4 million people im-
poverished, which would look 
bad for the administration. In 
another episode, Josh agrees to 
append a provision to a health 
care reform bill — not because he 
thinks it is a good idea (indeed, 
he has not researched the pro-
posal) but because the addition 
will persuade a recalcitrant sena-
tor to sign on. When Bartlet’s 
staffers take a more active role in 
shaping legislation, it is almost 
always by negotiating with politi-
cians on the president’s behalf 
and almost never by advocating 
for policies on their own merits.
often, the characters go so far 
as to concede that the adminis-
tration’s critics are right, at least 
behind closed doors. At one 
point, Sam finds himself at log-
gerheads with a Democratic sen-
ator intent on eliminating the 
penny — a proposal he comes to 
regard as reasonable but ends up 
rejecting on the grounds that it 
will make the president look 
foolish and piddling. (Just last 
month, the penny was retired

compelled to point out that for all 
the possible responses you 
suggest, you omitted the obvious 
one: apologizing.
They asked you to attend — or 
at least to tell them if you were 
unavailable — and you failed to 
do so. They made that difficult 
and expressed themselves 
inarticulately, but you knew what 
they meant.

In fact, I had tried to respond, 
but the language and mechanics 
of the response form were so 
confusing that it was actually 
impossible to decline (which was 
what I needed to do).
The administrator noted that 
faculty had been asked to state 
whether we wished to “request an 
rSVP,” by which he meant “a 
complimentary ticket.”
While I know it can be 
obnoxious to correct other 
people’s language use, I am 
confident that my adored miss 
manners can thread this needle 
adroitly.
While she appreciates the 
adoration and deplores the 
incoherent instruction you 
what we are doing that others 
find irritating.
miss manners therefore offers 
three gentle suggestions. 1. When 
you are the meal’s host, you can 
offer to clear a plate, simply 
explaining you were trying to be 
helpful when caught out. 2. You 
can disrupt the fidgeting by 
passing her items such as bread, 
or by asking if your friend would 
like to order something else. or, 3. 
You can go on with the 
conversation and try not to 
notice.
dear Miss Manners: I received a 
frosty email from an 
administrator at a performing 
arts institution where I teach, 
taxing me with not having 
responded to an invitation to an 
position of her cutlery that she 
has finished. So all of her fellow 
diners have to watch her shift the 
items to and fro, waiting for her to 
eat them.
once, a waitress finally asked if 
she had finished, and my friend 
was offended by the 
“impertinent” question.
Since asking whether she has 
finished is not an option, 
apparently, how can I politely 
make her stop playing with her 
food? It is unnerving to watch.
Other people seldom behave 
exactly the way we would wish. 
However, etiquette strictly limits 
our ability to correct such 
annoyances for a very basic 
reason: We would then have to 
reciprocate — and who knows 
there are more important issues 
to consider — technically, 
tradition does say that you are not 
supposed to toast with water. But 
now the more important issues: 
first, it is rude to correct another 
person’s manners. And second, in 
a work environment, when you 
may not know every co-worker’s 
personal situation, it is also 
foolish to draw attention to 
someone abstaining from alcohol.
Whoever did the admonishing 
will find that claiming it was 
good-natured will be of no help to 
them as a defense for their 
infractions.
dear Miss Manners: one of my 
friends endlessly plays with the 
food she does not want to eat, 
without ever signaling by the

company holiday 
party, one of my 
colleagues decided 
not to partake of 
the wine that was

admonished — in a good-natured 
way — by co-workers, for raising 
her water glass. They said

bad luck.
Aside from the luck angle, is 
there an etiquette rule covering 
what is in the glass used during a 
toast?

change the name without an act of 
Congress,” the members wrote.
“We’ll be working to block this 
disgraceful renaming effort at ev-
ery possible opportunity and re-
store the Kennedy Center’s right-
ful place as our nation’s cultural 
center without the burden of vani-
ty projects or political influence,” 
they wrote.
roger Colinvaux, a law profes-
sor at Catholic University, said his 
read of the statue establishing the 
center was “not quite as demon-
strative” as Beatty’s, but “I’d argue 
that the statute does not differen-
tiate among types of trustees in 
terms of powers and obligations, 
which would include voting.”
Colinvaux added that “basic 
governance principles” “do not al-
low for the ‘muting’ of members” 
of an entity’s governing body, 
which is a “deliberative body.”
Phil Hackney, a law professor at 
the University of Pittsburgh and a 
specialist in nonprofit tax-exempt 
organizations, said it’s worth not-
ing “how ex officio trustees have 
traditionally operated” at both the 
Kennedy Center and the Smithso-
nian, of which the Kennedy Cen-
ter is technically a bureau. He said 
that a court would also need to 
consider whether trustees are 
supposed to be able to remove ex 
officio members’ powers by 
amending bylaws.
That said, the statute says the 
trustees “have the usual powers,” 
and “it still strikes me, under what 
I see so far, that it is reasonable to 
believe that ex officio trustees 
might have the right to vote,” he 
said.
Ellen Aprill, senior scholar at 
UCLA School of Law, who has 
written about the Kennedy Cen-
ter’s legal status, said even if the 
bylaws limit voting to general 
board members appointed by the 
president, “I believe there is a 
strong argument that such a by-
law provision violates the Kenne-
dy Center’s charter.”
Aprill stressed that the charter 
includes a variety of public ser-
vants, and both majority and mi-
nority members of Congress in the 
Kennedy Center’s governance. 
“Clearly the intent of the charter 
provisions was to entrust Kenne-
dy Center guidance to a broad 
group, not just those appointed by 
the president,” she said.
Still, the Kennedy Center’s rela-
tively ambiguous legal status as a 
public-private entity “makes it dif-
ficult to predict how a judge faced 
with the issues in the case beyond 
standing would decide,” she said, 
noting the situation “is likely to 
give any judge a great deal of 
freedom in making any decision.”

Beyoncé is officially a billion-
aire, according to forbes, making 
her the third female musician in 
history to cross the threshold.
She becomes the fifth musi-
cian in the magazine’s billionaire 
club, joining Taylor Swift, rihan-
na, Bruce Springsteen and her 
husband, Jay-Z.
forbes said the release of the 
star’s 2024 album, “Cowboy Cart-
er,” and her accompanying tour 
— which was the world’s highest-
grossing of 2025 — fueled her 
10-figure fortune, along with a 
sprawling business empire, mu-
sic catalogue and new commer-
cial opportunities from the 
genre-shifting record.
The 
Cowboy 
Carter 
Tour 
grossed more than $400 million 
in ticket sales, according to trade 
publication Pollstar. forbes esti-
mated that she made $50 million 
from merchandise sold at the 
shows.
The star’s 2023 renaissance 
World Tour grossed more than 
$579 million, and her 2016 for-
mation World Tour more than 
$320 million, The Washington 
Post reported.
In December 2024, Beyoncé 
performed live during halftime 
at Netflix’s first Christmas Day 
NfL game, earning her an esti-
mated $50 million, forbes said, 
noting that she also capitalized 
on the country album’s aesthetic 
to bring in $10 million through 
Levi’s commercials.
forbes estimated that Beyoncé 
earned $148 million this year 
before taxes — making her the 
third-highest-paid musician in 
the world.
The magazine also cited her 
company, Parkwood Entertain-
ment, as a key to her financial 
success. The business produces 
her music, documentaries and 
concerts, giving the star in-house 
control over her empire. She 
stopped being managed by her 
father in 2010.
“When you get to this point in 
your career, you don’t have to go 
sign with someone else and share 
your money and your success — 
you do it yourself,” she said in 
2013 at the School of Visual Arts 
in New York.
It’s been quite a year for the 
star, who won the album-of-the-
year Grammy for “Cowboy Cart-
er” in february after four unsuc-
cessful bids for the top prize and 
picked up the award for best 
country album.
Ahead of the record’s release 
in march 2024, Beyoncé debuted 
two country-infused songs, be-
coming the first Black woman to 
top Billboard’s Hot Country 
Songs chart.
“Cowboy Carter” is an ode to 
Black Americans’ contributions 
to country music and was a hit 
with fans, who often donned 
cowboy hats and boots as they 
supported the Houston native. 
She has long celebrated her 
country roots despite ongoing 
scrutiny from some in the indus-
try who say she does not belong 
in the genre and fierce debate 
over what truly defines country 
music.
Beyoncé was shut out of the 
2024 Country music Association 
Awards nominations despite be-
ing one of the year’s biggest 
industry stories.
“The criticisms I faced when I 
first entered this genre forced me 
to propel past the limitations 
that were put on me,” the star 
wrote in an Instagram post last 
year, seemingly citing the back-
lash she received in 2016, when 
CmA viewers slammed her per-
formance of her country song 
“Daddy Lessons.”
The star said that it took more 
than five years to create the 
album and that it stemmed from 
a time when it was “very clear” 
she was not welcome. 
“Because of that experience, I 
did a deeper dive into the history 
of Country music and studied 
our rich musical archive,” she 
wrote.
“my hope is that years from 
now, the mention of an artist’s 
race, as it relates to releasing 
genres of music, will be irrele-
vant,” she added.

The board of the John f. Ken-
nedy Center for the Performing 
Arts voted earlier this month to 
rename 
the 
institution 
the 
Trump Kennedy Center, an un-
precedented change for the U.S. 
presidential memorial that drew 
swift condemnation from Kenne-
dy family members and Demo-
cratic leaders. Trump’s name was 
added to the exterior of the 
building a day after the board’s 
vote. Some legal experts have said 
that only Congress can change 
the center’s official name.
The cancellations on monday 
came days after musician Chuck 
redd pulled out of his annual 
Christmas Eve jazz concert, and 
KENNEDY CENTER frOm B1
after folk singer Kristy Lee an-
nounced she had canceled a con-
cert scheduled for mid-January.
“When American history starts 
getting treated like something 
you can ban, erase, rename, or 
rebrand for somebody else’s ego, I 
can’t stand on that stage and 
sleep right at night,” Lee wrote on 
social media last week.
A production of the musical 
“Hamilton,” a concert by Gram-
my and Pulitzer Prize-winning 
folk musician rhiannon Giddens 
and a show by comedian and 
television producer Issa rae that 
were set to take place at the 
center were canceled earlier in 
the year, after Trump’s takeover 
of the institution in february.
A statement posted on the 
Cookers’ website did not explicit-
ly mention Trump or the Kenne-
dy Center, but said, “Jazz was 
born from struggle and from a 
relentless insistence on freedom: 
freedom of thought, of expres-
sion, and of the full human voice.”
“To everyone who is disap-
pointed or upset, we understand 
and share your sadness. We re-
main committed to playing mu-
sic that reaches across divisions 
rather than deepening them,” the 
statement read.
Cookers band member David 
Weiss declined to comment fur-
ther when reached by email.
Saxophonist Billy Harper, a 
member of the Cookers who 
played in groups with Art Blakey 
and max roach, was more explic-
it about not wanting to perform 
at the Kennedy Center in an 
interview quoted on the face-
book group Jazz Stage on Satur-
day.
“I would never even consider 
performing in a venue bearing a 
name (and being controlled by 
the kind of board) that represents 
overt racism and deliberate de-
struction of African American 
music and culture,” he said. “. . . 
After all the years I spent work-
ing with some of the greatest 
heroes of the anti-racism fight 
like max roach and randy 
Weston and rahsaan roland 
Kirk and Stanley Cowell, I know 
they would be turning in their 
graves to see me stand on a stage 
under such circumstances and 
betray all we fought for, and 
sacrificed for.”

Center 
President 
richard Grenell, a Trump ap-
pointee, responded to the cancel-
lations with a post on social 
media monday evening, saying, 
“The arts are for everyone and 
the left is mad about it.”
“The artists who are now can-
celing shows were booked by the 
previous far left leadership. Their 
actions prove that the previous 
team was more concerned about 
booking far left political activists 
rather than artists willing to 
perform for everyone regardless 
of their political beliefs,” he said 
in a statement. “Boycotting the 
Arts to show you support the Arts 
is a form of derangement syn-
drome.”

Workers update the name on the Kennedy Center on Dec. 19.
during their tenure, but the per-
son did not recall a time when 
those members’ votes were count-
ed.
“Theoretically they could vote, 
but our practice was not to have 
them vote or count toward quo-
rum,” the person said, noting they 
were not aware of the new leader-
ship’s practices at the center.
for this report, The Post 
reached out to all ex officio mem-
bers with questions about their 
voting authority and any known 
changes to it. Some told The Post 
or other outlets that they under-
stood their current role to be non-
voting, though none addressed 
whether they were aware of any 
prior changes to that status.
“Like a lot of things, this seems 
to be in dispute,” said one person 
with knowledge of board proceed-
ings, who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity because they were 
not authorized to speak on the 
matter.
Senate majority Leader John 
Thune (r-South Dakota) told a 
reporter Dec. 18: “I don’t have a 
vote. I don’t know enough about 
it.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-
rhode Island) told The Post that 
he became an ex officio member 
this year after he became the lead 
Democrat on the Senate Commit-
tee on Environment and Public 
Works — another ex officio seat 
designated by Congress — but was 
not invited to board meetings un-
til his committee began investi-
gating the Kennedy Center last 
month.
Whitehouse said the statute 
“makes no distinction between ex 
officio and presidentially appoint-
ed Trustees when it comes to 
members’ rights and responsibili-
ties on the board, including vot-
ing,” and he accused the Trump-
appointed board of attempting to 
“illegally change the bylaws to 
silence dissent.”
A spokesperson for the Smith-
sonian Institution said that Secre-
tary Lonnie G. Bunch III does not 
vote or attend the meetings. It was 
unclear whether he had since as-
suming his role in 2019, but it is 
not uncommon for high officials 
serving on influential Washing-
ton boards to attend by proxy or 
not at all.
Copies of the Kennedy Center’s 
may and September board meet-
ing minutes, obtained by The Post, 
showed that many ex officio mem-
bers were absent or sent a staffer 
in their place.
cancellations at the center as the 
unprecedented move drew public 
scrutiny and backlash. Democrat-
ic lawmakers and legal experts 
said it is illegal to alter the name of 
the living memorial to Kennedy 
that Congress established. Demo-
crats also claimed that one ex 
officio member, rep. Joyce Beatty 
(D-Ohio), was muted when she 
attempted to speak out during the 
Dec. 18 vote.
roma Daravi, the center’s vice 
president of public relations, told 
The Post that ex officio members 
have never voted.
“The bylaws were revised to 
reflect this longstanding prece-
dent and everyone received the 
technical changes both before the 
meeting and after revisions,” Dar-
avi wrote in an email to The Post. 
“Some members (including ex of-
ficio) attended in person, others 
by phone, and no concerns were 
voiced, no one objected, and the 
bylaws passed unanimously.”
The Kennedy Center lists 34 
presidentially appointed board 
members, including Trump him-
self as chair, and 23 ex officio 
seats. The center’s president, 
richard Grenell, is also an officer 
of the board.
The federal law that estab-
lished the Kennedy Center desig-
nates specific government and 
federal positions — including the 
Librarian of Congress, the mayor 
of Washington, D.C., the secretary 
of the Smithsonian Institution, 
and the majority and minority 
leaders of the Senate — to serve as 
ex officio members.
The law identifies them as part 
of the board of trustees, which it 
directs to maintain and adminis-
ter the facility as a living memori-
al. But it does not distinguish 
between voting and nonvoting 
members, which has been a point 
of ambiguity in the days following 
the Kennedy Center renaming 
vote.
The center’s original bylaws 
didn’t distinguish voting powers, 
either. But its most recent tax 
filings list 59 “voting members” of 
its governing body — a total that 
includes both general and ex offi-
cio members.
A former Kennedy Center staff-
er with knowledge of board pro-
ceedings, who spoke on the condi-
tion of anonymity out of fear of 
retribution, told The Post that ex 
officio members were “always in-
cluded in debate and discussion” 
BOARD frOm B1
Critics say bylaw change 
may go against charter
the institution marked the most 
overt effort to date by the presi-
dent and his allies to remold the 
storied performing arts center in 
his image.
In the days since his name was 
added to the building, several law-
makers have vowed to fight the 
change.
During a rally outside of the 
Kennedy Center on Dec. 20, Van 
Hollen said he and his colleagues 
would work to “reverse” the move 
when Congress returns to session 
in January. “The day we get back, 
we can put an amendment on the 
… Interior appropriations bill to 
reverse this outrage,” he told the 
crowd.
Beatty’s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. 
District Court for the District of 
Columbia, claimed that the vote 
exceeded its statutory authority 
and requested that a judge declare 
it to be void.
“Because Congress named the 
center by statute, changing the 
Kennedy Center’s name requires 
an act of Congress,” the lawsuit 
says, adding that “Congress in-
tended the Center to be a living 
memorial to President Kennedy — 
and a crown jewel of the arts for all 
Americans, irrespective of party.”
Last week, rep. April mcClain 
Delaney (D-maryland) said she 
would introduce legislation to re-
move Trump’s name.
rep. Chellie Pingree (maine), 
the top Democrat on the Appro-
priations 
subcommittee 
that 
oversees the Kennedy Center, 
along with more than 70 lawmak-
ers in Congress, called for Trump 
to reverse the renaming effort and 
remove his name from the build-
ing immediately.
“No board vote nor social me-
dia post has the legal authority to 
cluding Secretary of State marco 
rubio, Health Secretary robert f. 
Kennedy Jr. and Senate minority 
Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-
New York), did not respond to 
requests for comment.
The offices of D.C. mayor muri-
el E. Bowser (D) and the acting 
librarian of Congress, robert 
Newlen, declined to comment.
Other changes from the may 
revision state that the general 
trustees “serve at the pleasure of 
the President.” (Previously, that 
language appeared in the bylaws 
and the federal statute only in 
reference to the Advisory Com-
mittee on the Arts, a separate body 
that makes recommendations to 
the board.) They also added lan-
guage about the ability of officers 
to make certain appointments, in-
cluding stating that the chair may 
appoint the center’s president to 
act as chief executive.
The vote by the Kennedy Cen-
ter’s board to add Trump’s name to 
Beatty, who sued the Kennedy 
Center’s board of trustees Dec. 22 
to stop it from adding Trump’s 
name to the institution, declined 
to comment for this story. But her 
lawsuit argues the center’s statute 
makes her a “a full voting mem-
ber.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-
maryland), who is listed as an ex 
officio member on the Kennedy 
Center’s website, said he is no 
longer part of the board. “I was on 
the Kennedy Center board … in 
the last Congress,” he told The 
Post. “So their website is not 
caught up because I was told 
when Democrats lost control of 
the Senate and the republicans 
became the majority that I fell off.” 
(The charter calls for three addi-
tional Senate members appointed 
by the president of the Senate and 
three House members appointed 
by the speaker to serve in ex officio 
seats.)

PREVIOUS SCRABBLEGRAMS SOLUTION
PREVIOUS SUDOKU SOLUTION
SUDOKU
BIRTHDAY | DECEMBER 31: 
You’re pragmatic and idea-
listic. You seek better ways 
of doing things. You’re reas-
onable and fair. This is a year of 
learning and teaching. Take time 
to renew your spiritual or religious 
beliefs. Explore philosophies that 
give you better self-awareness. 
This year gets more exciting as it 
wears on.
Moon Alert: Avoid shopping (except 
for food and gas) or important dec-
isions from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. 
today. After that, the Moon moves 
from Taurus into Gemini.
ARIES 
(March 21-April 19)
Today you have strong feelings and 
views about certain issues, which is 
why discussions with siblings, relatives 
and neighbors will be lively! Oh yes. 
You will say what you mean and 
mean what you say!
TAURUS 
(April 20-May 20)
You are the financial wizard of the 
zodiac, and today you have strong 
feelings about financial matters. This 
might be about earnings or a big 
expenditure. It might even be about 
something that you own. Be careful, 
because today it’s easy to become 
obsessed.
GEMINI 
(May 21-June 20)
Today the Moon is in your sign dancing 
with Pluto, which makes your feelings 
intense and your discussions charged 
with emotion. Take a breath and get 
things in perspective. The world is not 
going to end today. In fact, it’s already 
tomorrow somewhere else on the 
planet.
CANCER 
(June 21-July 22) 
Be cooperative with partners and close 
friends today because three planets are 
opposing your sign. This means it’s in 
your best interests to “go along to get 
along.” If you have an intense reaction 
to something, you’ll be quiet about it. 
(Just for today.)
LEO 
(July 23-Aug. 22)
Remember to listen when talking to 
friends and members of groups today. 
Listen with genuine interest and be 
polite, because it’s all too easy for 
conversations to become so intense 
they’re off the charts. Today is an 
emotionally charged day for many 
people. Keep it light. 
VIRGO 
(Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
You are high-viz today, which means 
people notice you more than usual. Be 
aware of the fact that discussions with 
bosses, parents and authority figures 
-- which might be intense -- will also be 
more public than usual. (You might end 
up hissing at someone in an elevator 
filled with others.) Stay chill.
LIBRA 
(Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
You are an excellent debater, and 
today you might get caught up in 
intense discussions about politics, 
religion or something about foreign 
countries. (These could be exhausting.) 
Remember that you need harmony in 
your surroundings for your own peace 
of mind. You come first.
SCORPIO 
(Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Today the Moon is dancing with your 
ruler Pluto, which will create intense 
feelings in you and others, especially 
if you’re dealing with inheritances and 
issues about banking, debt, taxes or 
shared property. Don’t come on too 
strong with others, because you are 
very powerful right now.
SAGITTARIUS 
(Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
The best advice for you today is to 
cooperate with spouses, partners and 
close friends -- even members of the 
general public -- because the Moon is 
opposite your sign. Feelings are running 
high! Naturally, with Mercury in your 
sign, you have something to say. Easy 
does it.
CAPRICORN 
(Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
It’s the last day of the year, and you 
hold all the cards with the Sun, Venus 
and fiery Mars all in your sign. Avoid 
disputes or emotional discussions 
with co-workers, which might arise. 
Do your best to keep things on an 
even keel so that everyone benefits, 
including you.
AQUARIUS 
(Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
Today has mixed messages for you. 
One message is that you want to party 
and socialize. You have strong feelings 
and expectations! However, the other 
message is that you might be best 
served by being low-key and staying 
quiet -- alone or behind the scenes. You 
choose.
PISCES 
(Feb. 19-March 20)
Relations with friends and groups are 
positive today. However, discussions 
with family members, especially 
parents, might be too emotional 
because both parties are obsessed 
about their point of view. Go gently.

— graffiti.
Grapefruit, our odious club mem-
ber, gets his name from his head 
(as bald as a mountaintop in winter) 
and his sour disposition. He was 
today’s East, and at four hearts, 
South took the ace of spades, led 
a club to the ace and returned a 
trump: spade from Grapefruit, jack, 
queen. West then led his last spade. 
South ruffed, took the top dia-
monds, ruffed a diamond in dummy, 
ruffed a club and ruffed a diamond.
South next ruffed a club and 
ruffed his last diamond for 10 tricks. 
He lost the last two tricks to West’s 
A-10 of trumps, and Grapefruit had 
his say.
“If idiots could fly,” he snarled, 
“this place would be an airport.”
When West takes the queen of 
trumps, he prevails by leading the 
ace and 10. He loses a trump trick 
but gains two tricks by stopping two 
ruffs in dummy. South survived a 
misplay: If he never leads a trump 
but starts a crossruff immediately, 
he can actually make an overtrick.
DAilY QUestion 
You hold: 
♠ J 7 5 3 ♥ 9 6 4 2
♦ 4 ♣ A 9 6 2
Both sides vulnerable. The dealer, 
at your left, opens one club. Your 
partner bids one spade, and the 
next player passes. What do you 
say?
AnsWeR: Bid three spades, pre-
emptive. With a stronger hand, you 
could start with a cue bid of two 
clubs. You have enough trumps and 
distribution to bid to the three level, 
so do so immediately and make 
things tough for the opponents.

years playing as a professional —
such as when he matched up
against Victor Wembanyama in
the summer after they came out
of the 2023 draft.
Wait a minute. What in the
name of image and likeness is
happening here? What happened
to the days when players
declared for the draft and
abandoned their amateur status,
leaving the college game to the
next generation of young
athletes?
Maybe it’s nCAA President
Charlie Baker, who released a
statement Tuesday emphasizing
the nCAA will not grant
eligibility to “prospective or
returning student athletes” who
have signed an nBA contract. “I
will be working with [Division I]
leaders in the weeks ahead to
protect college basketball from
these misguided attempts to
destroy this American
institution,” Baker wrote.
The way Baker made it sound,
college basketball is
experiencing a crisis. one thing
can help: The nCAA needs to
hire separate commissioners to
oversee Division I football and
men’s basketball. We need
leaders who would bring clarity
and install guardrails on these
multimillion-dollar industries
that are overflowing with media
rights and marketing deals but
short on good sense. These
enterprises need enforcement
SEE BUCkNER on B9
At this point, we
just have to accept
it: College
basketball is
trolling us.
Right? What
else would explain
how this game
keeps creating the
kind of content that even parody
social media accounts wouldn’t
touch? College basketball has
pushed boundaries so far that it’s
only tangentially related to its
amateur roots. The game is
clearly trying its best to out-crazy
the craziness of college football.
I see your graduated seniors
suing for an extra year and
junior college transfers who want
eligibility for eternity, and I
raise you James Nnaji.
Two years ago, nnaji was a
raw 6-foot-11 teenager out of
nigeria who drew comparisons
to nBA big men Clint Capela and
Mitchell Robinson. Since then,
he was drafted in the second
round by the Detroit Pistons,
played overseas as well as in the
nBA summer league — most
recently with the new York
Knicks — and apparently grown
an inch. Soon, he will head to a
college court near you to play for
the Baylor Bears.
In new weirdness for college
sports, an nBA draft pick has
signed with Baylor. Though the
7-footer never signed an nBA
contract or appeared in an nBA
game, he has spent the past two

dry, the first-term Republican
governor, has a giant megaphone
that he says a lot into — especially
when he can use LSU sports as a
springboard to the national con-
versation.
“We are not doing that again,”
Landry told reporters, referring
to the contract for former LSU
coach Brian Kelly, whom the
school had just fired but still
owed $54 million. The governor
joked that maybe President Don-
ald Trump should hire the Tigers’
next coach. By the end of the
week, Landry had pushed athletic
director Scott Woodward, who
hired Kelly, out of the job.
If people didn’t like Landry’s
approach — and a lot of them
didn’t — so be it. For the moment,
this was his hill, where he would
stand and shout and splash his
face across TV and the internet.
But that moment only lasted
four weeks. By late november,
LSU had agreed to a seven-year,
$91 million deal with Lane Kiffin,
luring him from SEC rival Missis-
sippi by making him the second-
highest-paid coach in the sport.
And the initial terms, at least on
the surface, crossed Landry’s line.
If LSU were to fire Kiffin before
the end of his deal, the payout
would be 80 percent of whatever
money was left. The terms also
didn’t include “offset” language,
meaning LSU could not get out of
paying at least some of Kiffin’s
buyout if the school let him go
and he found another job. Even

Anthony Rendon
played 257 games
for the Los
Angeles Angels —
about a season
and a half’s worth,
at least for everyday types.
The problem for the Angels,
who had hoped he would be their
third baseman for most of this
decade, is that Rendon was not
an everyday type. And six years
into a seven-year contract, he is
also no longer an active member
of the Angels: Rendon and his
agent, Scott Boras, reached an
agreement with the team to end
his contract a year early,
according to multiple people
with direct knowledge of the
settlement who spoke on the
condition of anonymity because
the move had not been
announced. Rendon, 35, hit
22 home runs in six years with
the Angels, a dozen fewer than he
hit for the Washington nationals
in the 2019 regular season alone.
Back in 2019, when Rendon
was fresh off a World Series title
and was one of the best right-
handed hitters in baseball, one
team or another was going to pay
him. So the fact that the Angels
committed $245 million to him
over seven seasons did not
necessarily seem absurd.
Still, Rendon was not a
no-brainer: For example, with
Stephen Strasburg also headed to
free agency, nationals ownership
felt it had a clear choice between
the two, and the team handed
the same contract to Strasburg
instead. The right-hander
appeared in just eight games
over three seasons of that deal
and retired at 35 because of

texas tech’s Morton
 at full strength for CFP
Texas Tech is 11-0 when 
quarterback Behren Morton 
plays this season, which is an 
obvious reason the Red Raiders 
made the College Football Playoff.
Here’s more good news: 
Morton said he’s fully healthy 
again.
The Red Raiders’ starter said 
Tuesday that he is 100 percent 
going into Thursday’s College 
Football Playoff quarterfinal 
against Oregon at the Orange 
Bowl. He had worn a walking 
boot for about two months while 
dealing with a hairline fracture in 
his right leg. 
It wasn’t a question about 
whether he would play — that 
was not in doubt — but the fact 
that he has been full go in bowl 
prep is a key development for the 
Big 12 champions. … 
Former Oregon and 
Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip 
Kelly was hired as 
Northwestern’s offensive 
coordinator. … 
Clemson is moving on from 
offensive coordinator Garrett 
Riley and longtime defensive 
assistant Mickey Conn after a

David Olano kicked a 29-yard 
field goal as time expired as 
Illinois beat Tennessee, 30-28, in 
the Music City Bowl in Nashville, 
clinching back-to-back nine-win 
seasons for the first time. … 
Trey Kukuk followed his 
fourth-quarter touchdown pass 
with a big run to set up Andrew 
Burnette’s go-ahead plunge in a 
17-point fourth quarter as 
Louisiana Tech rallied to beat 
Coastal Carolina, 23-14, in the 
Independence Bowl in 
Shreveport, Louisiana. … 
Nick Martinelli’s 32 points 
and six rebounds powered the 
Northwestern men’s basketball 
team (8-5) to an  80-60 win over 
Howard (9-6) in Evanston, 
Illinois.
Travelle Bryson led the way 
for the Bison with 19 points and 
six rebounds. Ose Okojie added 
13 points for Howard, which had 
won five straight games. … 
Palmire Mbu had 19 points; 
Sophia Vital added 14 points, 
seven rebounds and five steals;

Sunrise.
Suzuki also scored late in 
regulation to tie it for Montreal, 
which improved to  6-1-3 in its 
past 10 games. Cole Caufield had 
the other goal for the Canadiens.
Brad Marchand and Sam 
Reinhart scored for Florida, but 
Marchand was called for 
roughing 1:27 into overtime, 
giving Montreal a four-on-three 
advantage.
In a pregame ceremony, the 
Panthers paid tribute to 
Marchand for notching his

milestone in mid-November but 
chose this game — against the 
Canadiens, one of his longtime

coached by one of his idols, 
Martin St. Louis — for the formal 
celebration. … 
Anthony Mantha scored in his 
third straight game — this time 
notching two goals — to help the 
Pittsburgh Penguins beat the 
visiting Carolina Hurricanes, 5-1.
Justin Brazeau set a career 
high with his 12th goal and added 
an assist, and Tommy Novak and 
Sidney Crosby also scored for 
Pittsburgh, which has won three 
of four following an eight-game 
skid. Erik Karlsson had two 
assists and passed Brad Park for 
the 14th-most points by a

After 
Monday’s 
win 
over 
 McDonogh, 
the 
Cardinals 
watched Brooks and North Caroli-
na face off against Boston College, 
where former classmate Amirah 
Anderson plays. Brooks had 15 
points in the Tar Heels’ win, and 
Anderson scored five. That same 
night, Rodney Ward — Largo’s 
coach and Cam’s father — followed 
as his son had five points and four 
rebounds in a win over Cornell.
Reminders of their success are 
everywhere. Rodney Ward coach-
es with last season’s champion-
ship ring on his right hand. 
Brooks’s jersey hangs in Ireton’s 
gym to commemorate her all-
American selection and Gatorade 
state player of the year award.
With overhauled rosters, the 
programs have worked through 
growing pains. Ward and Brooks 
starred, but they were far from 
one-person teams — both graduat-
ed seven seniors after last season. 
Ireton doesn’t have a senior on 
this season’s roster after it lost five 
of its top seven rotation players, 
including Brooks, Anderson and 
guard Theresa Hagans Jr., now at 
Pittsburgh. Largo had three senior 
starters leave and is breaking in a 
handful of underclassmen.
Both teams are undeterred. Ire-
ton (8-2) bounced back from two 
losses to nationally ranked oppo-
nents in mid-December to rattle 
off five straight double-digit wins. 
It will soon jump into WCAC play, 
where there are few days off.
“Nyla and the rest of the seniors 
last year showed us how to play as 
a team, and even though every-
body’s getting their own, it’s still 
helping the team that’s the end 
goal,” junior Geornae Davis said.
Largo has made a habit of fin-
ishing strong, posting zero losses 
in February or March since 2023. 
The Lions’ defeat against Moon 
Area (Pennsylvania) on Monday 
dropped them to 3-2 but didn’t 
shake their belief.
“There’s a daily reminder from 
everybody else, like, ‘Man, you 
guys can’t do it this year now that 
Cam’s gone,’ ” Rodney Ward said. 
“But we don’t talk like that. It just 
comes with the territory.”

SALISBURY, Md. — Largo guard 
Jalen Johnson stood in a hallway 
just off the court at the Wicomico 
Youth & Civic Center, having just 
finished the fifth game of his se-
nior season. This is the program’s 
first campaign since reigning 
 All-Met Player of the Year Cam 
Ward graduated, and Johnson has 
seen plenty of posts on social me-
dia saying Largo won’t be the 
same. They emerged during the 
offseason and haven’t stopped.
“They keep saying Cam Ward 
this, Cam Ward that,” Johnson 
said.
A few hours later, just down the 
road at the University of Maryland 
Eastern Shore in Princess Anne — 
another site for the Governors 
Challenge, a high school invita-
tional — Bishop Ireton girls’ coach 
Kesha Walton echoed something 
similar. Her Cardinals keep hear-
ing they will take a step back now 
that the 2025 class has graduated, 
especially because All-Met Player 
of the Year Nyla Brooks is gone.
Brooks is now at North Caroli-
na, where she is averaging 10.9 
points for the No. 16 Tar Heels. 
Ward is at Michigan State and has 
carved out a role for Tom Izzo’s 
ninth-ranked Spartans, averaging 
6.2 points.
Back home, their high school 
programs have turned the page. 
Their new eras are easily defined: 
post-Nyla and post-Cam.
“They really want to continue 
what we’ve built and not make it a 
one-hit wonder,” Walton said of 
this year’s Cardinals. “Our stan-
dard is still the standard, and 
that’s what they hold themselves 
to.”
Largo boys, Ireton girls make 
fresh starts after stars depart
Ward was the most decorated 
player in Largo history, setting the 
Maryland public school scoring 
record with 2,716 career points. 
His last game in a Lions uniform 
brought their second straight 
Class 2A championship.
At Ireton, Brooks headlined the 
Alexandria program’s most ac-
complished senior class ever, lead-
ing the Cardinals to back-to-back 
Virginia Independent Schools

ships and their first appearance in 
the Washington Catholic Athletic

already down three starters 
because of injury — Gordon, 
Christian Braun and Cam 
Johnson — and its only 
traditional backup center, Jonas 
Valanciunas, is 33 and nearly 
left the NBA to play in Europe 
over the summer.
There’s some good news for 
the Nuggets: The next month of 
their schedule isn’t loaded with 
top-tier Western Conference 
opponents. But there’s bad news, 
too: Denver will play 16 games 
over the next four weeks, a 
grueling stretch that includes 
10 games on the road and four 
sets of back-to-backs. If Jokic 
remains out until after the 
 all-star break in mid-february, 
he would miss at least another 
eight games.
Under any timeline, the 
Nuggets appear headed for some 
major backsliding. Denver 
entered Tuesday as the West’s 
No. 3 seed with a 22-10 record, 
but they were only three games 
up on the No. 7 Phoenix Suns. 
Instead of battling the San 
Antonio Spurs for the West’s 
No. 2 seed and the right to be on 
the opposite side of the playoff 
bracket from the Thunder, the 
Nuggets could easily find 
themselves in the West’s play-in 
tournament field by the time 
Jokic returns. Denver should 
have a chance to reverse any 
negative momentum in the final 
months of the season, but 
drawing oklahoma City in the 
first round of the playoffs — 
rather than in the Western 
Conference finals — is suddenly 
an eventuality it must consider.
Until Gordon (hamstring) and 
Braun (ankle) return, the 
Nuggets’ fate will reside almost 
exclusively in murray’s hands. 
The Canadian guard has 
averaged a career-high 
25.2 points and shot a 
 career-best 45.4 percent on 
three-pointers this season, and 
he will be asked to push his 
scoring and distributing to even 
greater heights as he shifts from 
riding shotgun to the driver’s 
seat. While Jokic’s injury could 
prevent him from winning a 
fourth mVP award because 
candidates must play at least 
65 games, it could also help the 
28-year-old murray earn his first 
all-star selection.
That potential silver lining 
helps crystalize Denver’s state of 
play without Jokic. Either his 
teammates will rise to the 
occasion and make the case they 
were better all along than they 
have gotten credit for in Jokic’s 
shadow, or the Nuggets will 
tumble down the standings and 
thereby reinforce their franchise 
player’s singular value.
“You have to keep it moving, 
and we will,” Adelman said. “for 
[our team], in the moment, it’s a 
little bit of a shock. … These 
things happen. It’s part of life. 
We’ll move forward with the 
guys we have that are healthy. 
This group has enough to win 
some games — bottom line. We 
just have to keep our heads up.”
Even though Denver dodged 
the worst-case scenario, the 
road ahead until Jokic’s return 
will be unfamiliar and 
challenging with the potential to 
seriously complicate the 
Nuggets’ playoff outlook. for 
years, Jokic has taken on added 
responsibilities while 
teammates such as Jamal 
murray and Aaron Gordon 
recovered from injuries. Now, 
the rest of the Nuggets, who 
already were banged up, will be 
asked to return the favor. That’s 
an enormous ask given that 
Jokic has delivered another 
mVP-caliber season by 
averaging 29.6 points, a 
 league-best 12.2 rebounds and a 
league-best 11.0 assists, a stat 
line that hasn’t been seen since 
oscar robertson in 1961-62.
“It’s gut-wrenching, especially 
somebody as special as [Jokic] 
is,” Nuggets Coach David 
Adelman said monday after the 
miami Heat pulled away from 
the Nuggets for a 147-123 victory 
following Jokic’s injury. “You 
have to stay with it as a team 
and a group. That’s how you best 
support your teammates who 
are out: by honoring them when 
you play.”
Durability has long been one 
of Jokic’s many superpowers: 
The Serbian center has played in 
93 percent of Denver’s games 
since his 2015 arrival, and his 
777 games played during that 
time span rank third among all 
players. Since the beginning of 
his first mVP campaign in 
 2020-21, Denver has performed 
at a 55-win pace with Jokic on 
the court and a 30-win pace 
during his relatively rare 
absences. This season, that’s the 
difference between the Western 
Conference’s No. 4 seed and 
No. 12 seed.
As soon as Jokic ascended to 
stardom, Nuggets observers 
started splitting the team’s body 
of work into “Jokic minutes” and 
“non-Jokic minutes” to 
recognize his immense impact 
and ability to make his 
teammates better. So far this 
season, Jokic ranks third 
leaguewide in plus-minus: 
Denver has outscored its 
opponents by 304 points with 
him on the court, and it has 
been outscored by 72 points 
when he’s off the court. With 
Jokic, Denver has been the 
NBA’s most dominant team 
outside the defending champion 
oklahoma City Thunder. 
Without Jokic, the Nuggets have 
performed somewhere between 
the Atlanta Hawks and 
milwaukee Bucks, teams with 
losing records that are battling 
for the final spot in the Eastern 
Conference’s play-in 
tournament.
Needless to say, the 
impressive numbers that have 
driven Jokic’s mVP campaigns 
will now keep the Nuggets’ 
coaching staff up at night for the 
foreseeable future. Denver was

Jokic’s ﬁrst serious injury 
should reveal real Nuggets
their coaching peers all but 
shrug. Those in this fraternity 
see Drew and Sendek as just 
doing their jobs within the loose 
structure the NCAA has 
provided. What? You expect a 
basketball coach not to find 
every ambitious way around the 
rules, not to take a mile when 
given an inch? To not abandon 
integrity, that limp shell of a 
concept, on the side of the road 
while riding toward march?
“We really don’t have any 
organization or any real rules 
right now, and so guys are just 
trying to do whatever they can 
do,” Gonzaga Coach mark few 
told reporters Sunday. “Until 
there’s a rule that says you can’t 
do it, it’s hard to blame anybody 
for doing what they’re doing.”
True statement, but it’s still 
weak.
Blame the system, sure. That’s 
the easiest route, because right 
now the system is a basically a 
building in downtown 
Indianapolis. The NCAA is a 
faceless bogeyman that lets 
anyone appear big and tough 
while taking shots at it. However, 
coaches can’t simply turn a blind 
eye to the greatest rule-benders 
among them. If any coach could 
throw money at former salaried 
players who list their previous 
college as “Delaware Blue Coats/
NBA G League Ignite,” then why 
aren’t more Division I programs 
looking like pro-am rosters?
Believe it or not, there actually 
are coaches out there who still 
recruit kids out of high school in 
 two-time champion coach Dan 
Hurley of Connecticut told CBS 
Sports. “Who’s protecting college 
basketball, one of the most 
special things we have in sports? 
… We need a commissioner. We 
need rules, we need guidelines.”
Apparently no one. Well, not 
as much as they should be at 
NCAA headquarters after they 
cracked the doors to this strange, 
new world. By loosening 
eligibility rules, the NCAA has 
allowed, on a case-by-case basis, 
former professionals to play in 
college. In September, the NCAA 
granted Thierry Darlan, who 
played two seasons in the 
G League, two years of eligibility 
based on his age and years 
removed from the NBA Academy 
in Africa, according to ESPN. 
Entering Tuesday, Darlan had 
appeared in 14 games for Santa

“The coaches are obviously 
always going to do what’s in their 
best interest if they can grab a 
player from somewhere. It’s gone 
on forever,” Hurley said. 
“Coaches have cheated in 
recruiting for years. They’ve paid 
players. I mean, the coaches are 
going to find ways to make their 
team the best they can be.”
Coaches, naturally, won’t point 
fingers at one another. Instead of 
straight up calling out Baylor’s 
Scott Drew for drafting second-
round washouts into his 
program or mocking Santa 
Clara’s Herb Sendek for raiding 
the G League to win a few games 
in the West Coast Conference, 
because, as we continue to see, 
there’s nothing in place that will 
keep the stewards of the game, 
the coaches, from bending moral 
codes.
Wanting a college basketball 
commissioner isn’t a radical, new 
request. for decades — 
throughout his time at Duke — 
legendary coach mike 
Krzyzewski called for the 
position to be created. In 2013, 
Krzyzewski said he thought a 
basketball commissioner, not the 
NCAA president, was needed to 
run the sport on a day-to-day 
basis. Seven years later, amid the 
coronavirus pandemic, 
Krzyzewski argued a 
commissioner would help craft a 
unifying message for coaches to 
echo on issues involving health 
and safety, society and culture.
Now, the necessity of a 
commissioner is clearer than 
ever. The unregulated transfer 
portal has shown so. As has the 
confusion over what is 
permissible NIL money and what 
is not, although an enforcement 
committee is supposed to be 
handling this. Specifically in the 
Nnaji case, college basketball 
needs to know who should be 
allowed to play versus who has 
given up eligibility. Krzyzewski is 
retired, so the current kings of 
the court are taking on this 
cause.

looking out for the shield, the

Some coaches can’t be trusted 
amid all this crazy in college 
basketball. Some of them need to 
be taught how to uphold the 
values of the sport. And since too 
many of them keep playing fast 
and loose with the loopholes, this 
game could use a commissioner.

those teams.
But the Angels’ offer was too 
much to refuse: $245 million 
over seven years, bigger than any 
contract they had ever given. 
rendon took it. He looked like he 
might be worth it in the 
pandemic-shortened 2020 
season. Then injuries to his 
groin, left knee, left hamstring, 
right hip, right wrist, groin 
(again), left wrist, left shin, left 
hip, left hamstring (again), lower 
back and left oblique came to 
define his next four seasons in 
Anaheim. At the start of spring 
training in february, the Angels 
said rendon would undergo hip 
surgery that ended up sidelining 
him for the entire 2025 season. 
That meant he would enter this 
offseason with one year and 
$38.6 million remaining on his 
contract — so little, relatively 
speaking, that both sides might 
consider absorbing the cost of 
divorce.
The exact terms of that divorce 
— first reported by the Athletic — 
remained unclear as of Tuesday. 
rendon could remain on the 
Angels’ roster, though that does 
not matter much: He can move to 
the 60-day injured list so the 
team can replace him on the 
 40-man roster. He can, 
effectively, disappear. To some 
with his skills, disappearing 
would constitute a nightmare. 
for rendon, it always seemed 
like the dream.
was in 2014.”
In 2014, rendon was in the 
second season of his seven with 
the Nationals, finishing fifth in 
National League mVP voting and 
winning a Silver Slugger award. 
In his healthy years, he was a 
sure thing: from 2013 to 2019, he 
averaged 142 hits, 35 doubles, 19 
homers and 31 missed games per 
season. At those rates, he looked 
like an all-star worth signing 
long term. His home-state Texas 
rangers were interested. The 
New York Yankees and Los 
Angeles Dodgers reportedly 
were, too, and maybe things 
would have gone differently with 
Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper and 
max Scherzer, rendon always 
seemed less concerned about 
aging by comparison. He was a 
big leaguer by fate, not by choice 
— a hitting savant with hands so 
quick that they simply had to hit, 
even if their owner often seemed 
a little less invested.
“my enthusiasm has been the 
same since I got drafted, to be 
honest with you,” rendon said in 
that 2024 outpouring. “I was 
actually deleting old emails 
because my storage is getting to 
my maximum. … I emailed 
myself a pros and cons of why I 
wanted to stay in the game. This 
injury, though it would be hard 
to find a member of the mike 
rizzo-led regime that would tell 
you he was the wrong choice. 
People around the Nationals 
knew firsthand what rendon 
had said publicly for years: 
Baseball was never central to his 
identity, and he resented the 
attention it brought him.
“[Baseball] has never been a 
top priority for me,” rendon told 
the Athletic and others in 
february 2024, after he had 
played no more than 58 games in 
any of his first four seasons with 
the Angels. “This is a job. I do 
this to make a living. my faith, 
my family come first before this 
job. So if those things come 
before it, I’m leaving.”
Given the money the Angels 
paid him and how much injuries 
limited him in the first four years 
of his deal, those comments 
landed poorly with players and 
fans who rightfully point out that 
generations of people would do 
anything to have rendon’s job. 
rendon is just not one of those 
people. 
He never has been.
The Houston native had been 
injury-prone since college — he 
fell to the Nationals at No. 6 in 
the 2011 draft because of 
concerns over ankle and 
shoulder injuries. In a clubhouse

The Mavericks trade Luka 
doncic for ... not much: Never 
mind that, in the wake of the 
Doncic trade, the Dallas  maver-
icks wound up with Cooper flagg. 
They don’t get credit for  seeing a 
piece of outrageous good fortune 
fall into their collective  lap.
on the other hand, the maver-
icks deserved all the criticism they 
received — a Texas-size mass that 
didn’t subside for months — and 
not just because they dealt a mas-
sively popular, 25-year-old  super-
star who already had led them to 
the NBA finals. The return for 
Doncic and a couple of ancillary 
pieces to make the trade work 
included an aging and injury-
prone Anthony Davis, max Chris-
tie, a  first-round draft pick and … 
actually, that was it.
The worst part? Well, that’s a 
tough question, given that the 
trade came as an out-of-nowhere 
jolt of shocking news, left the  fran-
chise bereft of a long-term center-
piece (again, the subsequent,  ut-
terly fluky landing of flagg 
doesn’t count) and allowed the 
Los  Angeles Lakers to retain some 
assets that the mavericks should 
have  demanded as part of the 
package. maybe the most galling 
aspect was  that Nico Harrison, the 
mavericks’ 
general 
manager, 
didn’t shop  Doncic around the 
league, a process that almost cer-
tainly would have  yielded more 
substantial offers. Instead, Lakers 
Gm rob Pelinka  appeared to use 
his long-standing friendship with 
Harrison to pull  off a clandestine 
swindle. Plus, did it have to be the 
Lakers? You  know, the franchise 
that has lorded over the Western 
Conference for  huge chunks of the 
past 45 years and whose fans have 
come to expect  the regular arrival 
of elite players as their birthright?
None of that sat at all well with 
mavericks fans, and ultimately 
their fury and the team’s lack of 
success after the trade cost  Harri-
son his job. He’s no longer around, 
but the frustration of the  Doncic 
trade figures to linger in Dallas for 
years to come.

Kerkering 
throws 
home: It might be unfair to say he 
panicked, but Kerkering was 
hardly the picture of composure 
when the ball was hit back to the 
24-year-old Philadelphia Phillies 
pitcher in the bottom of the 11th 
inning of Game 4 of the National 
League Division Series. 
Kerkering  had trouble fielding 
the ball, but after he did eventual-
ly pick it  up, he appeared to have 
time to turn and throw to first 
base. Given  that there were two 
outs, a successful throw to the first 
baseman  would have ended the 
inning, kept the score tied and 
kept the  Phillies alive in their se-
ries against the Los Angeles Dodg-
ers.
Certainly, that was what catch-
er J.T. realmuto wanted. As  Kerk-
ering picked up the ball, realmuto 
was pointing toward first  base. 
Alas, the pitcher opted to throw 
home — the bases were loaded,  so 
an inning-ending out also could 
have been made at the plate — but 
he had only a split second to beat 
the runner, and Kerkering’s 
rushed effort sailed wide of real-
muto. The runner was safe at 
home,  the Dodgers spilled out of 
their dugout with joy, and the 
deCISIoNS from B7
Phillies  were forced to contem-
plate a brutal end to their season. 
Kerkering  defended his decision, 
saying he thought he could get the 
ball to  home plate faster than if he 
turned and threw to first, but he 
acknowledged, “It was just a 
 horses--- throw.”
The Clippers bring back Chris 
Paul: When the Los Angeles Clip-
pers signed Paul in July to a  one-
year contract, it seemed like a 
solid move, potentially even a 
heartwarming one — after all, 
Paul is a franchise icon, and he 
was  poised to help his team return 
to the playoffs in what could be his 
final NBA season. Instead, the re-
lationship between Paul — never 
one  to refrain from offering strong 
opinions on team-related matters 
—  and the Clippers’ coaching staff 
reportedly curdled almost  imme-
diately. Then, barely a quarter of 
the way through this season,  the 
40-year-old point guard was ban-
ished altogether.
Paul remains under contract, 
though, meaning that after get-
ting  the heave-ho, he is still essen-
tially getting paid handsomely by 
the  Clippers not to work. Wait, 
why does that sound familiar? oh, 
right  — their season began under 
a cloud of suspicion that they may 
have  circumvented NBA salary 
cap rules by arranging for Kawhi 
Leonard to  receive a lucrative, no-
show job from a team sponsor. At 
least  Leonard is doing his job for 
the Clippers by putting up good 
numbers, but he already has 
missed a chunk of the season with 
his  latest injury and, more omi-
nously, has proved unable to help 
the  Clippers avoid an early free 
fall that has them near the  bottom 
of the Western Conference.
A guy gets caught stealing a 
hat from a kid: Here’s the thing — 
If you’re going to swipe a cap 
clearly meant for a  kid, don’t do it 
where loads of cameras are pres-
ent. Wait, sorry,  here’s  the thing — 
Don’t do it at all. Alas, Polish 
businessman 
Piotr 
 Szczerek 
found it as easy in the moment as 
stealing candy from a  baby, only to 
discover his misdeed went viral.  
Caught red-handed at the U.S. 
open (tennis version), Szczerek 
subsequently issued an apology, 
but not before online sleuths 
found  his business and subjected 
it to damagingly poor reviews. 
Even in  his apology, Szczerek 
claimed it was “never my intent to 
steal away  a prized memento from 
the young fan,” leading to another 
round of  criticism.
Picking upsets in your brack-
et: Everyone knows that if you 
actually want to win your NCAA 
tournament pool, you can’t go 
chalk. While you may not be able 
to  predict which upsets will occur, 
you know they’re coming, so your 
best bet is to pick a few and hope 
you get some hits.
Unless, that is, you were filling 
out a bracket for the 2025 NCAA 
men’s basketball tournament, 
which turned out to be a chalk 
show.  The top 16 seeds won their 
first-round games, the only No. 12 
seeds  to get to the second round 
promptly lost, the only double-
digit seed  in the Sweet 16 was a 
John Calipari-coached SEC squad 
(No. 10  Arkansas, which promptly 
lost), and the final four was com-
posed  solely of No. 1 seeds. At 
least, at that point, Duke haters 
got to  see the Blue Devils get upset 
by Houston, but even that unex-
pected  result deprived hoops fans 
of seeing flagg in the national title 
game.
Tom Brady clones his dog: In 
thanking a biosciences company 
for giving him and his family “a 
second chance with a clone of our 
beloved dog,” Brady raised a  ques-
tion of what kind of “second 
chance” he thought he was get-
ting.  obviously, the first go-round 
went so well that he decided to 
have  the dog duplicated, so it 
wasn’t a question of making 
amends. At the  same time, the 
personality that so endeared the 
original pooch to  the Bradys 
wouldn’t necessarily be replicated 
in the clone.
What Brady could count on, if 
he cared to get some feedback, 
was  disapproval from animal 
rights activists and others who 
happen to be  well aware that tons 
of terrific pups are just waiting at 
shelters  for a loving human to 
come along. That act of compas-
sion could be  accomplished for a 
fraction of the price of cloning — 
and without  the possibility that 
several attempts might be dis-
carded before an  acceptable look-
alike was produced.
Chauncey Billups plays in 
shady poker games: Billups, the 
Portland Trail Blazers coach who 
was placed  on unpaid leave one 
game into the season after being 
arrested on  money laundering 
conspiracy and wire fraud con-
spiracy charges,  pleaded not 
guilty. Perhaps he did nothing 
wrong and is guilty only  of poor 
judgment — but, hoo boy, did he 
display some poor judgment  in 
getting involved in an allegedly 
mafia-backed scheme to use his 
celebrity to attract other poker 
players to illegal games so they 
could be defrauded with tech-
niques such as rigged card-shuf-
fling  machines. In addition, 
 Billups was accused by federal 
authorities of  passing along infor-
mation about the Trail Blazers’ 
plans to tank a  march game by 
benching players, which allegedly 
resulted in  big-money bets being 
placed on the contest.
If Billups plays his cards right 
(ahem) with the not-guilty plea 
and avoids what could be decades 
in prison, he still might be banned 
for life by the NBA, particularly if 
there is compelling evidence  that 
he did indeed share Portland’s 
tanking plans. At a minimum, he 
probably can kiss his coaching 
career goodbye, and his recent 
Hall  of fame induction could be in 
jeopardy.
A marathoner tries to help her 
maid: After ruth Chepngetich 
eventually provided an explana-
tion for how  she came to have a 
banned substance in her system, 
the Athletics  Integrity Unit de-
scribed her tale as “hardly credi-
ble.” Even if you  take her explana-
tion at face value, though, it 
doesn’t exactly do  her any favors.
Chepngetich, who smashed the 
women’s marathon world record 
in  october 2024 only to test posi-
tive 
for 
hydrochlorothiazide 
(HCTZ)  several months later, was 
said to have told investigators that 
she  fell ill with similar symptoms 
to those experienced shortly be-
fore  by her housemaid. According 
to the AIU, an agency established 
by  track and field’s international 
governing body to ensure athletes 
adhere to anti-doping protocols, 
the 31-year-old Kenyan asked 
what  medication her maid had 
taken and then promptly ingested 
it herself.  Chepngetich even pro-
vided a photo of the medication, 
which clearly  stated “Hydrochlo-
rothiazide” on its packaging, and 
she was said to  have claimed she 
didn’t know it was on the prohibit-
ed list.
The AIU noted Chepngetich 
had multiple opportunities to give 
her account of events before she 
provided the explanation and that 
it still didn’t account for the trace 
amounts of HCTZ found in a  test 
she took before the episode in 
question. She accepted a  three-
year suspension, although her re-
cord has been allowed to  stand, at 
least for the time being.
Bill Belichick agrees to go on 
camera: Infamously taciturn dur-
ing his two-decade run as the New 
England  Patriots’ coach, Belichick 
invariably gave the impression 
that  he would much rather be left 
alone to work on game plans in a 
darkened film room. After taking 
the North Carolina job, though, he 
was much more willing to go on 
camera. 
By 
doing 
so, 
the 
 73-year-old  also happened to 
shine more of a spotlight on his 
girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon 
Hudson. That may have been the 
plan  all along (for at least one of 
them), but it didn’t always go the 
way they would have liked.
most notably, Hudson’s com-
mandeering of a “CBS Sunday 
morning”  interview of Belichick 
in April raised widespread ques-
tions about  how much of a mana-
gerial role she seemed to have 
taken. When the  season started, 
she became a very visible presence 
on the Tar Heels’  sideline, and 
cameras also caught Belichick 
conferring with her  there shortly 
before games kicked off. In octo-
ber, video emerged  from an abort-
ed docuseries on Belichick by NfL 
films that showed  Hudson dis-
playing a high degree of involve-
ment and, at times,  casting asper-
sions on the work of production 
team members.
As for the on-field product 
Belichick produced, he probably 
wishes  that wasn’t filmed, either. 
In his first season at UNC, he 
oversaw a  4-8 season that began 
with an embarrassing blowout 
loss and included  four other de-
feats by at least 16 points.
Mississippi fans hope for 
Lane Kiffin to stay: Sure, Kiffin 
bolting for LSU just after guiding 
the rebels  to their best regular 
season since 1962 made for a 
messy ending in  oxford, but what 
did mississippi fans expect? Kiffin 
has departed almost  all of his 
coaching gigs with a trail of ill will 
in his wake, and  the LSU job has 
been a generally more coveted 
position for decades.
Nonetheless, a lot of mississip-
pi fans apparently expected Kiffin 
to stay, and many of them didn’t 
appreciate getting jilted. maybe 
now that he’s with the Tigers, 
some of those fans will learn that a 
leopard can’t change his spots.
FIFA creates a peace prize for 
the president: maybe, just maybe, 
if Donald Trump hadn’t been 
openly  pining for a Nobel Peace 
Prize, and if fIfA head Gianni 
Infantino  hadn’t been acting so 
openly 
obsequious 
toward 
Trump, the fact that  fIfA’s newly 
created peace prize just happened 
to go to Trump  wouldn’t seem like 
such a blatant case of currying 
favor. of course,  soccer’s interna-
tional governing body could rea-
sonably have some  major con-
cerns about the smooth staging of 
its 2026 World Cup — much  of 
which will be in the United States, 
which hasn’t exactly rolled  out the 
welcome mat for foreign visitors 
this year — that fIfA wants  very 
much to allay.
We’ll see how it goes next year 
with the world’s most-watched 
tournament, just as we’ll see who 
gets picked by fIfA as the next 
recipient of what it promises will 
be an annual honor. Presumably, 
the pool of candidates will be com-
posed solely of world figures  In-
fantino reckons will actually want 
to accept an award of such  dubi-
ous origin.
FIFA asks Wayne Gretzky to 
pronounce names of countries: 
At the same World Cup draw this 
month where Infantino handed 
Trump  his hardware, Gretzky was 
asked to help read names of  coun-
tries as they were slotted into pods 
for group play. While it  wasn’t 
ideal that he pronounced Curaçao 
as “Cuh-rocco” and North  mace-
donia as “mack-a-donia,” in fair-
ness, those probably aren’t  places 
he hears dropped into conversa-
tion very often.
But Jordan? or as Gretzky put 
it, “Jor-DAN”? Again, that’s a 
country not likely to be bandied 
about frequently in Gretzky’s 
presence, but you would think he 
has heard more than enough  com-
parisons to michael Jordan to just 
go with that as the default  pro-
nunciation.
NASCAR thinking it could 
win a court battle against Mi-
chael Jordan: Speaking of Jor-
dan, his latest showdown was in a 
federal  courtroom, not on an NBA 
court, but the outcome would 
have been  familiar to any number 
of Jordan’s opponents in hoops: 
NASCAr was  put on the proverbi-
al poster. Jordan and his 23XI 
racing team, along  with co-plain-
tiff front row motorsports, came 
away with a settlement  of their 
antitrust lawsuit that pretty much 
gave them what they  wanted. In 
turn, that amounted to a huge win 
for all the other Cup  Series teams, 
who also will benefit from the 
reported settlement  terms of per-
manent charters, greater revenue 
sharing and more say in  how the 
overall business operates.
The Charlotte-based judge who 
presided over the nine-day trial, 
which 
began 
approximately 
14 months after Jordan and his 
partners  filed suit, said he wished 
the settlement could have been 
reached “a  few months ago.” Some 
NASCAr officials probably felt 
the same way,  given some of the 
damaging details that emerged 
during discovery.  They reportedly 
included text messages from 
 NASCAr Commissioner  Steve 
Phelps to a colleague that called 
team owner richard Childress  a 
“stupid redneck” who should be 
“taken out back and flogged.”
It remains to be seen whether 
Phelps is able to keep his job, but 
there is little doubt that the orga-
nization he works for got dunked 
on by His Airness.
The choice of Keegan Bradley 
for Ryder Cup captain: Normally, 
active PGA Tour players are not 
chosen for the ryder Cup  captain-
cy. Bradley was not only very 
much still on the tour  but, in fact, 
played so well this year that he 
might have been a  captain’s pick — 
had he not been the captain him-
self. Technically,  Bradley could 
have selected himself, but he 
chose to focus solely on  his duties 
as captain.
The result of the ryder Cup — a 
15-13 win for Europe on American 
soil — made it fair to wonder 
whether it would have been better 
to  pick a captain who could have 
used the whole PGA Tour season 
to  focus on the event instead of 
finding time between tourna-
ments to  give it thought. Bradley 
was criticized for his pairings — 
particularly the duo of Harris 
English and Collin morikawa, 
whose 
 possible 
partnership 
ranked dead last out of 132 opti-
mal pairings in  a widely cited 
statistical model — as well as his 
course setup and  other tactics.
It seems safe to assume that, 
come 2027, the ryder Cup cap-
taincy  will revert to an accom-
plished player who has aged out of 
the PGA  Tour. Hmmm … Tiger 
Woods, anyone?
Mark Sanchez picks a fight 
over parking: At Sanchez’s trial, 
which was moved to  march, he 
might be able to present a con-
vincing case that he was the  victim 
in an october incident that left 
him in a hospital with stab 
wounds. The bizarre episode re-
sulted in a felony charge being 
brought against the former quar-
terback, who can now also be 
called a  former fox Sports analyst 
after the network parted ways 
with him.
In Indianapolis for a Colts 
game, Sanchez was said by  prose-
cutors to have been in a state of 
public intoxication when he  ap-
proached a 69-year-old man and 
allegedly took issue with where 
the  latter had parked his truck. 
The man was described as an em-
ployee of  a cooking oil recycling 
company who had brought his 
truck to a hotel  loading dock to 
perform his job duties before end-
ing up in a  physical confrontation, 
during which the man allegedly 
produced a  knife to defend him-
self from further attack.
Authorities cited surveillance 
video from a hotel in bringing 
charges, which indicates San-
chez’s legal team will have some 
work to  do. If he can’t adequately 
explain his side of things, Sanchez 
could  get prison time.

New England Patriots star wide 
receiver Stefon Diggs is facing 
strangulation and other criminal 
charges in connection with a dis-
pute with his former private chef, 
police said. 
News of the charges emerged 
after a court hearing Tuesday in 
Dedham, massachusetts. Diggs is 
charged with felony strangulation 
or suffocation and misdemeanor 
assault and battery.
Diggs’s lawyer, David meier, 
said in a statement that Diggs 
“categorically denies these allega-
tions.”
meier said the allegations never 
occurred, describing them as un-
substantiated and uncorroborat-
ed. A court arraignment is sched-
uled for Jan. 23.
In a statement, the Patriots said 
they are standing by Diggs. 
“We support Stefon,” the team 
said.
A police narrative in a court 
filing about the case said a woman 
came to the Dedham Police De-
partment on Dec. 16 to say that 
two weeks earlier, while working 
as a private chef for Diggs, he came 
into her bedroom and became an-
gry during a discussion about 
money. The woman told police 
that Diggs “smacked her across 
the face,” she tried to push him 
away, and then he “tried to choke 
her using the crook of his elbow 
around her neck.”
“She said that he was behind 
her with his arm wrapped around 
her,” officer Kenneth J. Ellis wrote. 
“She said that she did feel like she 
had trouble breathing and that 
she felt like she could have blacked 
out.” Diggs threw her on a bed and 
said “lies” when she told him she 
had not been paid, Ellis wrote.
The chef sought payment for a 
week in November when Diggs 
was having houseguests and she 
had to go home, Ellis wrote. The 
woman “left her position” and the 
home in Dedham but returned 
Dec. 9 to retrieve her property. At 
that point, she told police, Diggs 
referred her to his assistant, who 
told the woman she had to sign a 
nondisclosure agreement before 
she would be paid. She did not sign 
it, police said.
The woman was reluctant to file 
charges until last week, Ellis 
wrote, when “she let me know that 
she had changed her mind.”
l COWBOYS: Dallas waived 
cornerback Trevon Diggs, ending 
the tumultuous final season of his 
contract a game early in a career 
that never lived up to the promise 
of his 2021 all-pro performance. 
This season began with Diggs 
playing in the opener, earlier than 
expected coming off his second 
major knee surgery in two years. 
He suffered a concussion in an 
accident at home oct. 16, some-
thing he waited two months to try 
to explain to reporters. He said he 
was trying to install a TV when he 
was hit in the head by a mounting 
pole. 
As Diggs’s absence continued 
after he was out of the concussion 
protocol, the team said his delayed 
return was more about issues with 
the 27-year-old’s knees. He ended 
up missing eight games.
l STEELERS: Pittsburgh could 
have outside linebacker T.J. Watt 
back for Sunday night’s show-
down with the Baltimore ravens 
for the AfC North title. 
 Coach mike Tomlin said he is 
“more optimistic” than he has 
been that the perennial Pro Bowl 
edge rusher will be available after 
sitting out the past three games 
while recovering from surgery to 
repair a partially collapsed lung 
suffered following a dry needling 
treatment. 
 Tomlin added that he would 
like to see Watt practice fully at 
some point this week. Watt was a 
limited participant last week be-
fore being held out of Sunday’s 
loss to the Cleveland Browns, a 
setback that cost the Steelers a 
chance to clinch the division title.

Diggs faces 
charges in 
spat with 
his ex-chef
yer. But Carmouche insisted 
working with Landry was easy.
“After [Woodward] left, every-
thing kind of calmed down,” he 
said. “[Landry] then trusted that 
we would proceed in a way to 
protect the state.”
Still, LSU had to move fast. 
florida and florida State were 
wooing Kiffin behind the scenes, 
according to ESPN, while missis-
sippi promised to match any offer 
in terms of salary and roster fund-
ing.
LSU interviewed two other 
candidates — missouri’s Eliah 
Drinkwitz and frank Wilson, 
LSU’s interim coach after Kelly 
was fired — but remained focused 
on Kiffin, Carmouche said. Those 
involved were set on making a 
splash. And the key person, ac-
cording to fletcher, the longtime 
political operative, was James 
B. “Pepper” rutland, a big-time 
booster and a former LSU line-
backer. fletcher said rutland 
bankrolled multiple aspects of 
the pursuit of Kiffin, including 
the private jet that ferried Kiffin 
from oxford to Baton rouge.
“Pepper rutland was absolute-
ly essential to this thing because 
he wrote the checks,” fletcher 
said. “... I think that Pepper just 
said: ‘To hell with it. I got the 
money. Let’s roll, boys. Let’s go get 
him.’ ”
In text messages to The Post, 
rutland downplayed his role in 
the pursuit of Kiffin, saying it is 
“completely incorrect” that he 
was the “key booster” who helped 
land Kiffin. rutland said LSU 
made two trips to oxford during 
Kiffin’s courtship. The Post then 
provided rutland flight records 
showing that three private jets 
owned by mmr Group, the engi-
neering 
juggernaut 
rutland 
founded, made a total of six trips 
from Baton rouge to oxford and 
back between Nov. 17 and Dec. 2.
“Nothing really to tell here,” 
rutland responded. “I’ve met 
Lane Kiffin once, at our Hangar in 
Br. That’s it.”
He did not respond to further 
requests for clarification.
The Sunday after Thanksgiv-
ing, after weeks of drama, Kiffin 
announced he had accepted the 
job at LSU. once the terms of his 
deal became public, robert 
mann, a retired LSU journalism 
professor, saw history repeating 
itself. In his book about Gov. Huey 
Long — who, in the 1930s, trans-
formed LSU with an iron fist — 
mann noted Long hurt LSU foot-
ball with his frequent meddling, 
including hiring and firing coach-
es himself. mann suggested that 
LSU had paid Kiffin more than it 
needed to because of a “Landry 
tax.” Almost all conversations 
about Landry’s involvement with 
LSU football will lead to compari-
sons with Long.
But Carmouche emphatically 
rejected the idea that LSU paid 
more than it needed to because of 
Landry. He felt Kiffin actually 
liked Landry’s “spunk,” and dur-
ing Kiffin’s introductory news 
conference, the coach said he had 
a “unique, great call” with the 
governor. Kiffin complimented 
Landry’s “passion and energy for 
the state of Louisiana and for LSU 
football.”
Lipsey, the major donor and 
former board chair, described 
Landry in a similar way, saying, 
“As a first-term governor, he got 
just a little excited and over-
stepped.” And whether that will 
trail Landry like some sort of 
scarlet letter is the subject of 
statewide debate. Lipsey estimat-
ed that 90 percent of Louisianans 
were unhappy with how Landry 
acted after LSU fired Kelly, 
whether they voted for him or 
not. on the other hand, John 
Couvillon, a nonpartisan pollster 
based in Baton rouge, said Lan-
dry’s involvement was a “nothing-
burger” that won’t affect him if he 
runs for reelection in 2027.
for a while, Landry moved on 
to other issues, staying uncharac-
teristically quiet on LSU sports. 
He had started the whole saga 
with a battle cry against a broken 
system, wagging his finger as he 
talked, and ended it with some 
standard-issue governor-speak, 
congratulating the school in a 
staid post on X: “I would like to 
congratulate the great team we 
have assembled to lead LSU into 
the future. They have done an 
outstanding job at recruiting a 
new head coach!”
But that didn’t last long. In late 
December, Trump named Landry 
the special envoy to Greenland, 
putting the governor back in na-
tional headlines. A few days later, 
on Christmas Eve, Landry pub-
lished an op-ed on college sports 
for conservative outlet realClear-
Politics. And this week, Yahoo 
Sports reported that Landry and 
Kiffin may attend the Sugar Bowl 
together 
Thursday 
in 
New 
 orleans to watch Georgia face 
Kiffin’s old team.
“To those critical of LSU’s 
coaching search and my role in it, 
I say: don’t hate the player, hate 
the game!” Landry wrote in the 
op-ed. “We did what we had to do.”
 position by giving Kelly such a 
one-sided deal. Then, during a 
news conference at the state capi-
tol, Landry blasted Woodward 
and said he would not be allowed 
to hire the next football coach.
In a screed about not letting 
powerful agents control the 
coaching market — and not 
standing for the massive buyouts 
that keep showing up in contracts 
— he mixed up some of those 
agents. But the facts weren’t the 
point. The point was showing 
how dang mad he was.
Landry kept bashing Wood-
ward on local sports shows until 
he eventually resigned. Lipsey, 
the prominent donor, received 
texts from friends around the 
country asking him what in the 
world was happening in Louisi-
ana.
“It was just a clown show,” 
another former board member 
said. “We were only missing the 
floppy shoes and red lipstick.”
But while it felt, in the moment, 
as though that week could be a 
permanent stain on Landry’s 
 résumé, there was one clear way 
to avoid a complete disaster. LSU 
would just need some private 
planes.
Getting their man
minutes after Landry vowed 
that LSU wouldn’t sign another 
big-buyout deal at the state capi-
tol, the phones of LSU officials 
started blowing up. By that point, 
LSU had zeroed in on Kiffin, the 
consensus top choice because of 
his ability to design an offense 
and build a program, several peo-
ple with knowledge of the search 
said.
But it would be difficult to get 
him away from mississippi, 
where he had resurrected his ca-
reer and led one of the greatest 
six-year runs in school history, 
including an 11-1 record this sea-
son. LSU wasn’t only asking Kif-
fin, 50, to leave the place where he 
says he got sober and found con-
tentment. LSU was asking him to 
become the first coach to walk 
away from coaching a team into 
the College football Playoff.
Naturally, Kiffin and Jimmy 
Sexton, the superagent who rep-
resents him, wanted an eye-pop-
ping payday. But to get Landry on 
board with that, the board knew 
from the beginning that it needed 
to address how a potential buyout 
would be paid.
It took a week of meetings 
among Carmouche, Verge Aus-
berry (who replaced Woodward 
as AD) and other key stakeholders 
to formalize the plan for the buy-
out provision, Carmouche re-
called. Including the Tiger Athlet-
ic foundation in Kiffin’s contract 
— or at least exploring whether 
that was possible — became the 
surest path to satisfy Landry. And 
as for the TAf’s ability to pay a 
buyout if necessary, it has a war 
chest of $127 million in unre-
stricted assets, according to its 
2024 audited financial statement.
Landry is more influential with 
LSU’s board than a typical first-
term governor, and not just be-
cause of how comfortable he is 
waging battles in public. After he 
took office, his allies passed a bill 
that enabled him to select the 
chairs of 150 state boards and 
commissions, 
including 
the 
state’s 
four 
higher-education 
boards. So even though Landry 
has only appointed about half of 
LSU’s board members at this 
point, the bill makes the entire 
board less likely to cross him, 
according to people familiar with 
the power dynamics.
from the outside, as LSU 
chased Kiffin, several people 
speculated that the volatile gover-
nor was being kept in check by 
Carmouche, a laid-back trial law-
letes be present for the national 
anthem or risk their athletic 
scholarship! This is a matter of 
respect that all collegiate coaches 
should instill.”
But the team, as part of its 
pregame routine, was never on 
the court during the national an-
them. It had nothing to do with 
the anthem or patriotism, only 
the timing of its warmups.
once he realized his mistake, 
Landry asked Woodward to 
scramble together a statement 
from LSU athletics, according to 
two people with knowledge of the 
back-and-forth. Landry and his 
team then asked to edit the state-
ment before LSU put it out, those 
people said.
“It would have taken one call to 
get the story straight,” a former 
LSU athletics official said. “But, 
no, he just started tweeting what-
ever would get him the most 
likes.”
Landry has helped funnel state 
money to other sports. That in-
cludes $1.5 million for a UfC 
event, $5 million for a U.S. Bowl-
ing Congress tournament and 
$7 million for a LIV Golf event, 
$5 million of which will go to LIV 
as a hosting fee. But nothing has 
seemed to catch his attention as 
LSU football has.
In the fall of 2024, LSU officials 
refused Landry’s request to bring 
the school’s live tiger mascot to 
the football field, so he arranged 
for a different tiger to be brought 
in from florida for a short trip 
around the field. After LSU got 
crushed by Alabama, 42-13, he 
bashed his critics as “woke” and 
said: “our live tiger, unfortunate-
ly, disappointingly, was the only 
tiger who showed up Saturday. 
I’m sorry.”
This past fall, after LSU lost big 
to Texas A&m at home, Landry 
took another shot at the flounder-
ing Tigers on X, posting, “I think 
@LSUsports and the LSU Board 
of Supervisors needs to rethink 
their actions to raise ticket prices 
for next year after tonight’s show-
ing!”
The next morning, a group of 
LSU leaders decided on a confer-
ence call to negotiate Kelly’s buy-
out down before officially termi-
nating him, according to Car-
mouche. But a few hours later, 
Woodward jumped the gun, Car-
mouche said, and fired Kelly 
“without cause,” meaning the 
school would have to pay his full 
buyout.
The governor was “blown 
away,” according to Carmouche, 
and summoned allies to his man-
sion to strategize about how to 
handle the $54 million buyout. 
The next day, Landry began rag-
ing in public, blaming Woodward 
for putting the school in this 
the Bengal Belles, an LSU fan club 
for women.
There wasn’t an empty seat in 
the room. And when Emmert said 
he was surprised to see so many of 
them at games still, given the 
Tigers’ losing record, a woman in 
the back stood up.
You don’t get it, Emmert re-
membered her saying. WE will 
always be here. It’s YOU who 
won’t be if this doesn’t turn 
around.
“The football team really be-
longs to the people there, which 
will make fans — and, yes, some-
times politicians — act in certain 
ways,” said Emmert, who would 
later become president of the 
NCAA. “And it’s the only city I’ve 
lived in where, if you ask a little 
boy what he wants to be when he 
grows up, he might just say gover-
nor of Louisiana.”
But there is a key difference 
between Emmert’s tenure and 
this moment: republican mike 
foster, Louisiana’s governor from 
1996 to 2004, had very little inter-
est in football. In fact, Emmert 
doesn’t remember foster attend-
ing games.
Landry, however, has often 
used LSU sports as a prop for 
attention. The 55-year-old rode 
the state’s rising red tide to the 
governor’s mansion in 2024, talk-
ing big, fighting hard and, as one 
former LSU athletics official put 
it, “obsessed with getting Trump’s 
attention.” He cut deals to ad-
vance his agenda — the local 
newspaper called him “mAGA 
but pragmatic” — but usually not 
before rushing headlong into sit-
uations in which he could exer-
cise or consolidate power.
“The media says we’re moving 
too fast,” Landry told one crowd 
early in his tenure. “I think we’re 
not moving fast enough.”
“His composition as a person 
demands that he take charge, 
even though sometimes he may 
not even know where he’s going,” 
said political operative roy 
fletcher, who chuckled at the 
thought of people who don’t fol-
low politics meeting Landry 
through the LSU football drama. 
“right out of the gate, he took a 
meat ax to the whole thing.”
The first time Landry lever-
aged LSU sports was in April 
2024, less than three months after 
he took office. His target was the 
LSU women’s basketball team. 
Having noticed the Tigers were 
not on the court during the 
 national anthem before a high-
profile NCAA tournament game, 
Landry took to social media. In 
his post, which has been viewed 
more than 2.5 million times, he 
wrote: “It is time that all college 
boards, including regent, put a 
policy in place that student ath-
Kelly’s contract had offset lan-
guage.
Landry, though, was oddly qui-
et after LSU hired Kiffin. Publicly, 
he had gone from railing against 
giant contracts to tacitly endors-
ing this one, congratulating Kiffin 
and the school on social media. 
But privately, he had struck a 
secret, previously unreported 
deal with LSU power brokers, 
John H. Carmouche, chair of the 
board’s athletics committee, told 
The Washington Post. According 
to Carmouche, the board agreed 
to explore a provision that would 
formalize — in writing — that 
donors, not the state, would pay 
all of the buyout money if Kiffin is 
fired before his contract runs out.
The goal, Carmouche said, is 
for any potential buyout money to 
be underwritten by the Tiger Ath-
letic foundation, the athletic de-
partment’s fundraising arm. LSU 
had not included this kind of 
provision in previous contracts 
for marquee coaches such as Kel-
ly, Ed orgeron, Les miles, Kim 
mulkey and Jay Johnson. School 
officials are still ironing out the 
details of Kiffin’s contract, which 
includes figuring out how to le-
gally make this buyout provision 
work, but they have some time. 
The board isn’t scheduled to offi-
cially approve the contract until 
its next meeting in late february.
“We can’t just assume people 
are going to step up and pay for it,” 
Carmouche said of a potential 
buyout for Kiffin, describing what 
triggered these discussions in the 
first place. Schools typically don’t 
use taxpayer dollars for buyouts. 
But Landry insisted on putting in 
writing that donors would foot 
the bill, no questions asked, be-
cause the governor believed the 
state could have wound up on the 
hook for some money owed to 
Kelly if the coach had won a 
since-resolved lawsuit against 
LSU, according to Carmouche.
As of mid-December, Car-
mouche said that, having talked 
with the lawyer working on the 
contract, he was optimistic the 
buyout provision could be includ-
ed.
It was the year of the massive 
coaching buyout as public schools 
such as Penn State, florida, mich-
igan State, oklahoma State, Ken-
tucky, UCLA and Auburn also 
fired football coaches still owed 
millions. But only in Louisiana 
did the governor make himself 
the main character, affecting the 
school’s coaching search and pos-
sibly risking political capital in 
the process.
The episode was a rare window 
into what happens when two of a 
state’s most powerful institutions 
collide, when a loud-barking gov-
ernor uses sports as a prop and 
when hanging over everything is 
a most American question: Who 
will pay?
This story is based on inter-
views with more than a dozen 
people involved in LSU athletics, 
plus a dozen more who work in or 
around Louisiana politics. Sever-
al spoke on the condition of ano-
nymity, saying they would rather 
avoid Landry’s wrath, describing 
him as a vindictive politician with 
a good memory.
“Governor Landry has consis-
tently put Louisiana’s taxpayers 
and LSU fans first by ensuring the 
state is not responsible for buyout 
obligations and by preventing 
ticket price increases,” Kate Kelly, 
the governor’s spokeswoman, 
wrote in response to a list of 
detailed questions. “That is trans-
parent and responsible leader-
ship. LSU Athletics is the crown 
jewel of Louisiana — an institu-
tion this administration is active-
ly working to protect and 
strengthen.”
Woodward and two LSU athlet-
ics representatives declined to 
comment or did not respond to 
requests for comment.
Before LSU landed Kiffin, peo-
ple across Louisiana were irate 
with Landry, particularly with 
how he chased Woodward out of 
town, and worried the governor 
may chase away top coaches, too. 
But after LSU landed Kiffin, the 
top coach on the market, those 
feelings — and any potential po-
litical consequences — are more 
complicated.
“He better hope that time will 
heal,” said richard Lipsey, a ma-
jor LSU donor, a former board 
chair and a prominent Baton 
rouge businessman. “Because 
right now, his popularity dimin-
ished a great deal because of what 
he did.”
A real Tiger
mark Emmert hadn’t been 
LSU’s chancellor for a year. But in 
November 1999, toward the end 
of a second straight losing season, 
Emmert knew he had to fire foot-
ball coach Gerry DiNardo.
The school would have to pay 
DiNardo $600,000 to not coach. 
of course, not everyone would 
agree with the move. So after he 
let DiNardo go, Emmert met with 
groups around town, including 
LSU from B7

The Justice Department sued 
Virginia for granting in-state tu-
ition to undocumented students, 
saying the policy violated federal 
law by favoring those students 
over citizens who live outside 
Virginia and don’t qualify for 
in-state benefits.
The lawsuit, filed Monday in 
the eastern District of Virginia, 
asks a federal judge to bar the 
state from enforcing the policy, 
saying it “is not only wrong, but 
illegal.”
“In Virginia and nationwide, 
schools cannot provide benefits 
to illegal aliens that they do not 
provide to U.s. citizens,” said 
Attorney General Pam Bondi in a 
news release. “This Department 
of Justice will not tolerate Ameri-
can students being treated like 
second-class citizens in their own 
country.”
Virginia is the seventh state to 
be sued by the Justice Depart-
ment over similar policies across 
the country. Currently, 22 states 
and the District of Columbia 
have laws or policies that grant 
in-state tuition to undocumented 
students.

Government says state in 
violation of federal policy

Heading into the new year, the 
nation’s capital is gripped by eco-
nomic gloom that may perma-
nently alter the shape of the city 
as the forces that long under-
pinned its growth weaken all at 
once.
Unemployment rose steadily 
through the summer, climbing 
above levels last seen in 2021 to 
reach nearly 7 percent by early 
fall, a reflection of the private 
sector struggling to absorb thou-
sands of laid-off federal workers 
who fell victim to the Trump 
administration’s slashing of the 
bureaucracy. Consumer spend-
ing fell sharply in late summer 
after holding up earlier in the 
year. The longest government 
shutdown in history closed top 
sightseeing attractions, further 
fueling the woes of declining 
tourism.
Those pressures are already 
reshaping daily economic life in 
Washington and the city’s sur-
rounding suburbs, showing up 
most visibly in empty offices, 
struggling restaurants and softer 
demand across retail and hospi-

In the Washington area, families are mourning the

the surgeon who patched up newborns’ hearts; and 
the plumber who moonlighted as a youth football

“That is a good thing for our 
economy and society — to have 
educated people who are in Vir-
ginia,” she said. “These are some 
of the hardest working kids, and I 
believe they deserve access to a 
degree.”
She said she hopes Spanberger 
will stand up to the Trump ad-
ministration and defend the poli-
cy once she takes office Jan. 17.
Sookyung oh, the executive 
director of the Asian American 
advocacy group Hamkae Center, 
said her organization worked 
alongside coalition partners to 
help draft portions of the original 
bill to ensure it complied with a 
federal code. That code requires 
that if a noncitizen is granted a 
postsecondary educational bene-
fit on the basis of residency, then 
a U.S. citizen must also be grant-
ed that same benefit.
oh argued that policies like 
Virginia’s — which grants in-
state tuition not based on resi-
dency but based on high school 
attendance, among other re-
quirements — do not prevent a 
U.S. citizen in another state from 
qualifying for in-state tuition.
“This is a policy that benefits 
all students,” she said.
other states have raised simi-
lar arguments in court, though 
no federal judges have ruled on 
this question yet.
The Justice Department ar-
gued in its complaint that, fol-
lowing 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s executive orders to limit 
benefits for undocumented im-
migrants, any aid given to those 
immigrants must also be avail-
able to citizens, regardless of 
where they live. Department law-
yers argued the policy does not 
do that, and is therefore discrimi-
natory.
Department lawyers asked the 
court to issue a permanent in-
junction that would bar the state, 
including future leaders, from 
granting the benefits.
sors of the legislation to allow 
students access to in-state tu-
ition, said it aimed to stabilize 
Virginia’s economic future by 
educating kids who could work 
in high-demand jobs in health 
ment Tuesday. A spokesperson 
for Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger 
(D) also did not respond to a 
request for comment.
State Sen. Jennifer B. Boysko 
(D), who was one of the co-spon-
Education Aimee Guidera and 
the offices of outgoing Gov. 
Glenn Youngkin and Attorney 
General Jason miyares, both re-
publicans, did not immediately 
respond to a request for com-
for the 2025-2026 academic year. 
The cost to out-of-state students 
can exceed $66,000.
It was not immediately clear 
how the state of Virginia will 
respond. Virginia Secretary of 
gardless of legal status, who at-
tends two years of high school in 
Virginia and who paid, or whose 
parents paid, state income taxes, 
among other requirements, can 
receive in-state tuition and other 
aid. The law was passed in 2020, 
when ralph Northam (D) was 
Virginia’s governor.
In republican-led states such 
as Texas and oklahoma, state 
attorneys general made settle-
ment 
agreements 
with 
the 
Trump administration this sum-
mer that struck down policies 
providing in-state tuition to un-
documented students. The reso-
lutions were approved by local 
federal judges.
In Texas, that deal was cement-
ed and approved by the court 
within six hours of the Justice 
Department’s suit, drawing com-
plaints from students and activ-
ists that they were denied a 
meaningful opportunity to op-
pose the effort.
Both 
of 
those 
settlement 
agreements remain under review 
by appellate courts. The depart-
ment’s efforts to obtain similar 
judgments eliminating in-state 
tuition policies in Kentucky, Illi-
nois, minnesota and California 
remain 
pending 
in 
district 
courts.
An estimated 510,000 undocu-
mented students attend institu-
tions of higher education across 
the country, including roughly 
13,000 in Virginia, according to 
the Presidents’ Alliance on High-
er Education and Immigration, 
an advocacy group made up of 
U.S. college and university lead-
ers.
Costs at top Virginia universi-
ties can vary by tens of thousands 
of dollars for in-state and out-of-
state tuition. At the University of 
Virginia, for example, the cost of 
in-state undergraduate tuition 
for a first-year student ranges 
from roughly $16,500 to $27,000

eral restaurants in D.C., includ-
ing Prost, madhatter and Shaw’s 
Tavern and employs 250 people.
“We’re in a heavy-bout fight,” 
Heidenberger said.
Some of his D.C. locations have 
seen sales drop 20 to 30 percent 
over the last four years compared 
with pre-pandemic levels. “We’re 
trying to be resourceful and make 
ends meet so we wouldn’t have to 
cut labor,” he said.
Diane Gross, co-owner of Cork 
Wine Bar in Logan Circle, said 
the dampened demand coupled 
with increased prices for wine 
and food due to inflation and 
tariffs has made business tough. 
Sales have been down between 10 
and 30 percent over the course of 
this year, she said. She used to be 
able to absorb some of the cost 
increases, Gross said, but lately 
some prices have jumped so 
much that she can’t afford to.
Due to job losses in the region, 
she and other restaurateurs said 
they’re noticing that when people 
do go out to eat or drink they’re 
spending less.
“They’re cutting out appetiz-
ers,” she said. “You notice less 
steaks being ordered and more 
flatbreads. Less duck confit and 
more orders of fried calamari.”
Now, she has servers take on 
more tables and has cut back 
employees’ hours. She let three 
people go and has a manager — 
instead of a host — seat people on 
nights business is slow. For the 
holiday season, she’s noticed con-
sumers held smaller parties and 
she received fewer orders for gift 
baskets.
“We keep plugging along,” she 
said, “because even though it’s 
difficult we always think what 
else would we do? We’re a neigh-
borhood spot and it brings us so 
much joy.”
As a result, Shawn Townsend 
— president and chief executive 
of the restaurant Association of 
metropolitan Washington — said 
he’s heard from many of his 1,500 
members in the region as they 
navigate higher costs while de-
mand softens. Some are closing, 
others are cutting down on staff 
and adjusting their menus to 
keep them simple.
“The margins continue to be 
razor thin,” he said.
Eric Heidenberger, partner at 
DC restaurant Group, said the 
economic changes have hit his 
business. His company owns sev-
“So far, it has probably out-
weighed the renewed focus on 
in-office work.”
The effects are spilling beyond 
office towers and into the city’s 
consumer economy, where the 
slowdown has been sharper and 
more sudden.
For many restaurateurs, this 
year has been especially tough, 
marked by what they describe as 
multiple 
punches: 
inflation, 
changes to D.C’s wage policy, job 
cuts that have led to consumers 
spending less, Trump’s tempo-
rary police takeover and fears of 
ICE raids.
District held up through the first 
half of the year before dropping 
sharply in August and Septem-
ber, a decline far steeper than in 
the surrounding region. “The last 
two months have been the worst,” 
said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow 
at Brookings.
Federal jobs are down 5.6 per-
cent year over year, compared to 
a 3.1 percent decline nationwide, 
according to a joint analysis pub-
lished in early December by 
Brookings and the metropolitan 
Washington Council of Govern-
ments, a nonprofit association of 
jurisdictions in the region.
meanwhile, private-sector job 
growth has slumped. While the 
country as a whole experiences a 
decrease in unemployment rate, 
it is up by 0.65 percent in the D.C. 
region, with rates of unemployed 
workers growing the most in Vir-
ginia counties.
Commercial real estate experts 
said many companies are con-
tinuing to shed office space local-
ly, extending a shift that began 
during the pandemic and driving 
up the vacancy rate.
Another change this year has 
been the pace at which office 
buildings are disappearing alto-
gether. In 2025, 3.7 million square 
feet of office space was torn down 
in the D.C. region, up from 2.8 
million the year before, said meli-
na Duggal, senior director of 
market analytics for the D.C. and 
Baltimore regions for CoStar 
Group which tracks commercial 
real estate trends.
Those trends long predate 
2025, but federal job cuts have 
added new pressure to an already 
fragile market, said Phil mobley, 
CoStar’s national director of of-
fice analytics. “The federal gov-
ernment’s personnel reductions 
are certainly a drag,” mobley said.

any major metro area, according 
to the Brookings Institution, rais-
ing concerns about people being 
pushed from their homes due to 
increased economic instability or 
lured to other parts of the coun-
try for stronger job prospects — 
or both.
By the second quarter of 2025, 
the District had come within a 
whisker of a recession, with three 
months of declining GDP fol-
lowed by another three months of 
flat growth.
“Death by a thousand cuts,” 
said Yesim Sayin, executive direc-
tor of the D.C. Policy Center, a 
local think tank. The significance 
of 2025, she said, lies less in any 
single data point and more in the 
earthquake it has delivered to the 
very bedrock of the city’s long-
term outlook.
“This isn’t just a blip,” Sayin 
said. “What this year has done is 
change the trajectory of the Dis-
trict’s economy.”
D.C.’s government has begun to 
register the shift. Its most recent 
financial plan, submitted to Con-
gress in october, struck a notably 
cautious tone, framing priorities 
around affordability and main-
taining services rather than ex-
pansion. on monday, city offi-
cials released a revenue report

 tOny tucker Jr. 
Tony Tucker  grew up in the District, where his commitment to hard work started early. 
BY EMMANUEL FELTON
B
lake Pierce still remembers how brisk 
the air was as he ran onto the football 
field on a chilly fall day in 2004. As the 
quarterback for the Bowie Bulldogs, he had 
reached the local youth league championship, 
where he was facing off against a Chantilly 
team known for its stellar defense. He was 
nervous, but he knew he could count on his 
coach, Tony Tucker, who kept the team cool 
and composed even as they trailed by six 
points in the fourth quarter.
Pierce threw the game-winning touchdown 
pass.
He would go on to play football and basket-
ball in high school and in college. And like so 
many of his teammates, he remained close 
with Tucker, whose generosity, work ethic and 
commitment to his community inspired a 
whole generation of boys in Bowie.
“He was a big person for a lot of people my 
age,” Pierce said. “Coming up on 25 years later, 
people still talk about Coach Tony.”
Tucker, who died at 59 after a six-year battle 
with cancer, built a life defined by reliability, 
magnanimity and an unshakable, quietly radi-
ant strength.
He grew up in the District, where his 
commitment to hard work started early. Long 
before most teenage boys were awake, Tony 
was already dressed and working, joining his 
father on the back of the garbage truck his dad 
owned. Those early mornings taught him 
discipline and responsibility — traits that 
never left him.
At Eastern High School, he was the kind of 
football player coaches remember, the kind 
who seems destined for college athletics. But 
after dropping out of high school, he found a 
new passion. Job Corps training led him into 
plumbing, a profession he saw as practical, 
steady and deeply necessary. Eventually he 
started his own business, Tony’s Drain Servic-
es. Always looking to serve others, after 
Hurricane Katrina, he traveled to New Or-
leans to help families rebuild.
Outside  work, Tucker loved spades, pool, 
dominoes, cookouts and the noisy, joyful 
gatherings that he hosted for his family and 
friends. He had a gift for forming bonds that 
lasted. “Even when he was in the hospital sick, 
he was cracking jokes with the nurse,” said his 
son, Tony Tucker Jr., a heavily recruited 
defensive end who played for the University of 
Pittsburgh. “Even in all that pain, you could 
just really see his spirit.”
The Bowie community knew him not just as 
a businessman and father, with five children 
in his blended family, but as Coach Tony — the

Long after Pierce played in the youth league 
championship, when he launched a career 
flipping houses, he knew exactly the plumber 
he wanted to work with. “I didn’t understand 
it back then,” Pierce said, “but for him to be as 
successful as he was in his career, and then be 
at practice every night from six to eight, five 
days a week, really showed how much he cared 
about us.”

n that late summer night when he was 
at the center of the dance floor, spin-
ning in his wheelchair to pop music 
while decked out in a pink plaid suit, cobalt 
smoking slippers, red nail polish and a white 
fedora, it seemed impossible to picture where 
L. Thomas Mangrum Jr. had started out.
Because decades ago, Mangrum was very 
shy. And very wounded. And unsure about 
how to find his voice as a Black, gay, 
developmentally and physically disabled per-
son growing up in Washington, at a time 
when people like him were often institution-
alized.
But by the time he was dancing under the 
lights at a friend’s wedding in August 2024, 
Mangrum had blossomed. Slowly at first — 
then rapidly — he became a familiar and 
respected leader in the city’s disability rights 
community.
A little over a year later, Mangrum was gone 
at 61.
He had seemed to be everywhere. He 
testified before the D.C. Council, advocating 
for funding to support educational programs 
for people with disabilities. He trained law 
students at American University and medical 
students at Georgetown, discussing the needs 
of the disabled. He advised the Capital Pride 
parade organizers, helping ensure the route 
was wheelchair-accessible. And as a leader of 
Project ACTION!, a self-advocacy coalition, he 
led letter-writing campaigns in the 2010s that 
got the “R-word” eliminated from D.C. gov-
ernment rules, policies and documents.
In his advocacy, he spoke in a way that was 
both “kind and demanding,” said Phyllis 
Holton, a longtime advocate for people with 
developmental disabilities. She befriended 
Mangrum when he was in his 20s, taking 
continuing-education classes and learning to 
live independently.
“He will hold your feet to the fire. He will 
tell you point blank: ‘You could be doing 
things better,’” said Susan Brooks, whose firm 
RCM provides services for people with dis-
abilities. Brooks, who became his support 
person during covid, said Mangrum’s focus 
was always on making sure people were 
happy and getting the same opportunities, 
disabled or not. “Be more person-centered,” 
he would say. “More creative, more forceful.”
At 6-foot-4, 250 pounds, Mangrum didn’t 
roll into a room unnoticed. He had a broad, 
ever-present smile and dressed with splashes 
of color, like a chunky aqua necklace, or a 
string of burgundy and pink beads. His shirts 
went pow; his fedoras were festooned with 
birds. Feather boas wrapped around his chair. 
When he sang, as he did through Players 
Unlimited — a theater group featuring per-
formers with disabilities — his voice boomed, 
especially on the Broadway show tune “The 
Impossible Dream (The Quest).”
Mangrum was still looking for a rambler, a 
one-story house good for accessibility, when 
he was diagnosed with Stage 4 stomach 
cancer earlier this year. A supreme planner, 
he had laid out his desires for his funeral long 
before. He got just what he wanted: “His hair 
dyed burgundy, his fingernails red and a baby 
blue hearse,” Holton said. “Nothing black. 
And music with an LGBTQ theme.”
“You have to learn to love yourself,” Man-
grum had said earlier in the year, addressing 
others with disabilities. “And accept every-
thing about you.”
Lucius Thomas Mangrum Jr. was born 
March 9, 1964. He lived in Washington and 
died Sept. 17.

o Frank Midgley, there were thousands 
of Melissa Greene Smiths. But to Smith, 
there was only one Dr. Midgley, the 
man who sewed a tiny piece of fabric over a 
hole in her heart when she was just 4 years 
old, the man who saved her life.
She barely remembers the day of the 
operation. But Midgley’s name became a 
fixture in her household, and the scar he left 
on her chest a symbol of survival. Smith is 
one of many who would have perished 
without Midgley’s intervention, and when 
the pediatric surgeon died in September at 
86, she could feel his legacy in her heartbeat.
When Midgley first picked up his scalpel in 
the 1960s, performing open-heart surgery on 
children was a rare and risky undertaking. 
But by the time he placed his last suture, 
more than 40 years later, the survival rate 
had skyrocketed, and the operation had 
become commonplace. Midgley spent his 
career pioneering techniques to make such 
surgeries safer and more successful.
“He is forever a main character in my life, 
and he always will be,” said Smith, now 37 
and married with a young son. “I feel 
honored to have a scar on my body that was 
cut and sewn by such an extraordinary man.”
Born and raised in Yonkers, New York, 
Midgley trained with surgeons in Michigan 
and London before coming to Washington in 
1974, joining what is now Children’s National 
demurred.
“He said, ‘I’m just the plumber,’” his wife, 
Sally Brown, recalled.
He was always fixing things.
Brown met him when she was 43, a single 
mother of four coming off a difficult divorce. 
Midgley, who had two grown children from a 
previous marriage, helped raise Brown’s kids, 
teaching them how to drive and how to stitch 
up wounds, setting them up to practice on 
raw chicken breasts. Despite his occupation, 
he had a prodigious sweet tooth: doughnuts, 
ice cream, orange soda.
His work was intense, and sometimes 
tragic. Yet he rarely seemed stressed.
“His attitude was, ‘How can I not do this?’ ” 
Brown said. “ ‘I know how to fix this baby, so 
how could I not?’ ”
Some of his feats became hospital legend. 
Like the time he ran a marathon early one 
morning and then performed a complicated 
heart transplant late that night. He helped 
separate conjoined twins and operated on 
Quinn Bradlee, the son of Washington Post 
journalists Sally Quinn and Ben Bradlee, the 
paper’s longtime executive editor.
Some 25 years after Midgley patched the 
hole in Smith’s heart, she had a chance to 
meet him, thank him, hug him. “I was 
wide-eyed and starstruck,” she said.
What he told her still echoes: “Take good 
care of yourself.”

1939. He lived in Potomac and died Sept. 6.

she thought,” the younger Peyser said, recall-
ing that not long after they met, Gentilly told 
him, “You know your dad is going to lose, 
right?”
Peyser’s father lost in a landslide. But the 
bond he and Gentilly forged on the campaign 
trail led to a committed romance, and a 
quintessential D.C. love story: two ambitious, 
politically engaged young people, crowding 
their days with endless work.
“We both had demanding jobs,” Peyser said. 
“But we understood each other’s commit-
ments.”
By the early 1990s, Gentilly was one of the 
highest-ranking female staffers on the Hill, 
serving as executive director of the House 
Democratic Caucus. The day before her car 
crash, she accepted a new job at the PR firm 
Hill & Knowlton.
Gentilly’s accident meant that she was not 
on hand as her daughter, Kim Peyser, grew, 
married and had a child of her own. But her 
example inspired Kim to go into politics her-
self, with appointments in the Obama and 
Biden administrations.
“Part of what drew me to this kind of work is 
my mother’s legacy,” she said. “There is some-
thing that pulls me about the real world 
impact that policy decisions can have.”
Penny Eileen Gentilly was born June 6, 
1946. She lived in Rockville and died Feb. 9.

t’s no secret that Kasey Zachmann loved 
Christmas. She loved the lights and the 
carols, the gift-giving and the trimming of 
the tree. She loved Santa Claus, “Home Alone” 
and baking with her family. She loved the way 
the holiday seemed to make things, and people, 
sparkle.
For a little girl who spent half her life in and 
out of hospitals and doctors’ offices, undergoing 
treatment for brain cancer, Christmas was 
transportive.
Kasey’s yuletide enthusiasm inspired hun-
dreds of families near her Maryland home to 
organize an elaborate community Christmas 
this year, six months ahead of schedule, after 
doctors warned her cancer had spread and she 
was running out of time.
Kasey didn’t make it to December. She died 
Aug. 16, two months after the June celebration 
and about two weeks after her 10th birthday. 
Her story inspired friends, neighbors and 
strangers to donate hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to medical research and clinical trials, to 
raise awareness about pediatric cancer, to hang 
up holiday lights in the sweltering summer 
heat.
But Kasey was more than her diagnosis. An 
artist, a big sister and a natural performer, she 
lit up onstage and often requested to perform at 
her dance recitals solo. She loved rainbows and 
music and having pork chops for dinner. She 
refused to eat red gummy bears and didn’t like 
roller coasters. She never got used to being 
stuck by needles at the doctor’s office, hating it 
every time.
Diagnosed with medulloblastoma when she 
was 5, Kasey endured chemotherapy, surgeries, 
dozens of rounds of radiation and a rigorous 
medication regimen, including two experimen-
tal drugs she tested in clinical trials. Through it 
all, her parents held out hope that they might 
find a cure, a way to save their eldest daughter.
But earlier this year, the Zachmanns learned 
that the cancer in Kasey’s brain had made a rare 
and fatal progression. That’s when Alyssa, her 
mother, emailed their neighbors, asking for 
help bringing a little Christmas cheer to what 
they believed could be Kasey’s last few weeks.
Her parents said she packed as much joy into 
her final two months of life as any kid could — 
parties and presents and a vacation with her 
family.
“It was like she took whatever she had left, 
both energy wise and happiness wise, and spent 
it on that Christmas in June, the week at the 
beach, and her birthday,” said her dad, Joe 
Zachmann.
Before Kasey died, her parents preserved 
their daughter’s voice in a metallic green Christ-
mas ornament bearing her photo. It’s been hard 
to listen to this year, they said. But they’re glad 
to have it — for Christmases to come, and for 
every holiday season they will mark without 
her. With the press of a button, her small voice 
rings out from the family’s tree: “Merry Christ-
mas.”
Kasey Vivian Zachmann was born July 30, 
2015. She lived in Chevy Chase and died Aug. 16.

riving down a rain-slicked road in 
Bethesda in June 1991, Penny Gentilly, a 
longtime Capitol Hill staffer on her way 
home to Potomac from an aerobics class, 
collided head-on with a van. The crash, in a 
vehicle without air bags, put her into a coma, 
derailing the life of the 45-year-old mother and 
D.C. political operator.
It also helped transform the future of auto-
mobile safety in America.
With encouragement from the consumer 
advocacy group Public Citizen, her husband 
Peter Peyser, a lobbyist, was soon walking the 
halls of Congress, pitching lawmakers on new 
safety standards proposed as part of a massive 
transportation bill.
“If there had been air bags in Penny’s car,” he 
would say, “she could be here talking about 
this.”
The blunt force of Gentilly’s story — deliv-
ered by a grieving partner whose wife was in 
the hospital with a traumatic brain injury, and 
whose 7-year-old daughter was devastated 
back at home — nudged reluctant lawmakers 
to include a measure requiring air bags for the 
driver and front-seat passenger in all new cars. 
The bill was signed into law that December, 
after previous air-bag proposals had been 
blocked in the House, rejected by lawmakers 
opposed to new federal regulations.
“She had such a good reputation on Capitol 
Hill,” Peyser recalled, “and hearing her story 
made it personal for the representatives.”
In the aftermath of the crash, Gentilly 
achieved what every idealistic young profes-
sional drawn to Washington politics hopes for 
— monumental change. But she never recov-
ered enough to understand how her own 
injuries had impacted millions. For more than 
three decades, she lived in a nursing home in 
Rockville, where she died in February at 78.
Raised in Northern California, Gentilly be-
came interested in politics while studying at 
the University of California at Berkeley. She 
went on to campaign for George Moscone, a 
San Francisco progressive who was elected 
mayor in 1975, and moved to Washington to 
work as a congressional staffer, first for Leon 
Panetta and then for Peter A. Peyser, an inde-
pendent-minded Republican from New York.
When Peyser launched a longshot Senate 
campaign in 1976, Gentilly pitched in to help. 
She soon met her future husband, the candi-
date’s son.
“She was very direct and didn’t hide what 
 Penny Gentilly, who was severely injured in a car crash, helped make air bags mandatory
Kim and PeTer Peyser
Before the summer of 1991, Penny Gentilly was living a life similar to many ambitious young professionals 
who migrate to D.C.: She was a former Capitol Hill staffer married to a man who also worked in politics.

ANN SARKIS RYON (Age 73)
Ann Sarkis Ryon, 73, passed into eternal
life peacefully in her sleep on Thursday, De-
cember 18, 2025. She was born on October
16, 1952, in Springﬁeld, Massachusetts, and
was raised by two loving parents, John and
Marie Sarkis, whom she cherished so dearly.
Ann is survived by her husband, Michael
Ryon of Warrenton, VA; her beloved son,
Connery Ryon, and daughter-in-law, Ainsley
Ryon, of Fort Walton Beach, FL; her sister,
Mary Sloan, and her husband Rod of Inver-
urie, Scotland; her brother, Joseph Sarkis,
and his wife Ann-Marie of West Springﬁeld,
MA; and a long line of nieces, nephews, and
cousins.
Ann grew up in West Springﬁeld, Massa-
chusetts, where she attended St. Mary’s
High School (1970). She often spoke of her
wonderful childhood, blessed with devot-
ed parents and the best brother and sister
she could have ever wished for. In 1993,
she married Michael Ryon, and in 1996 they
welcomed their cherished son, Connery,
into the world.
Ann was extremely proud of her career and
wore many hats throughout her life. She
served in the federal government for over
33 years, including at the State Department
and, at the time of her passing, the Feder-
al Aviation Administration. She also retired
from Continental Airlines at Reagan National
Airport after more than 20 years of service.
In addition to her federal career, Ann was
an adjunct professor at Laurel Ridge Com-
munity College, where she taught ballroom
dance with her husband and, most recent-
ly, ﬁlm studies - two passions she enjoyed
sharing with others.
A lifelong learner and lover of academia,
Ann earned four master’s degrees from
Wesleyan
University,
Springﬁeld
College,
American University, and Georgetown Uni-
versity. At the time of her passing, she was
enrolled in a Doctoral Program at George-
town University, fulﬁlling one of her lifelong
dreams.
Her legacy lives on not only in her family, but
in the many dear friends who found in Ann
a conﬁdante, a cheerleader, and a steady
source of ove and encouragement. She
always wanted the best for everyone and
some of her passions and favorite things
were theater, dance, See’s Candies, cherry
blossoms, and—most of all—spending time
with her son, family, and friends.
Ann’s family will receive family and friends
on Friday, January 2, 2026 at Moser Funeral
Home, 233 Broadview Ave, Warrenton, VA.
from 5 to 8 p.m. A funeral service will be
held Saturday, January 3, 2026 in the funeral

CROWLEY
JOHN WILLIAM CROWLEY
John William Crowley, 78, of Chevy Chase,
Maryland passed away on December 8,
2025. John was born on October 4, 1947, in
San Antonio, Texas to John M. and Bernadine
(Enright) Crowley.
After graduating from the University of South
Florida in 1968, John joined the Peace Corps,
serving in a rural agricultural program in
Northeastern Thailand, and
subsequently
worked on the editorial desk for the daily
English language papers The Bangkok World
and The Bangkok Post. From 1977 to 1990,
he worked with the International Rescue
Committee in Thailand as part of the Joint
Voluntary Agency, where he screened In-
dochinese refugees for U.S. resettlement.
Among them was Dr. Haing S. Ngor, who hon-
ored John in his autobiography.
John became a Foreign Service Ofﬁcer with
the U.S. Department of State in 1990, serving
with distinction as a political ofﬁcer in the
United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand,
and Australia, as well as deputy political ad-
visor for the U.S. Paciﬁc Command in Hawaii.
He retired in 2012, after serving as Senior
Advisor with the Global Initiative to Combat
Nuclear Terrorism in the Bureau of Interna-
tional Security and Nonproliferation.
He was humble, a superb listener, and qui-
etly funny at exactly the right moments.
To his family, he was simply Dad—present,
watchful, helpful, and endlessly loving. At
home, he was happiest with a puzzle in prog-
ress, a backyard bird to identify, a long walk
downtown on the Capital Crescent Trail, or
mastering the daily Wordle or Spelling Bee
challenge, always achieving “Genius” sta-
tus. He ﬁlled the bird feeder every morn-
ing, photographed passing wildlife and his
favorite birds, and always had time for one
more walk outside with his beloved dogs,
Sampson and Minnie. He is survived by his
wife, Sivalee; daughters, Jamie and Allison;
brothers, Tim and Patrick, and sister Anne;
and dog, Minnie. Services are to be private.

where she enjoyed many summers. She was
born on August 17, 1930 in Buenos Aires,
Argentina to Terese Jane Curry Ducote and
Charles Huesmann Ducote, a United States
Foreign Service Ofﬁcer. Consuelo spent her
early years in Buenos Aires, Havana, Cuba,
Paris, and Boston. Graduating from the Bos-
ton Notre Dame Academy, she then received
her undergraduate degree in Art History from
the Sorbonne University in Paris and Mary-
mount College. She was ﬂuent in French,
Spanish, and Portuguese. She met her be-
loved husband William F.G. Lykes (Bill), a Na-
val Academy Midshipman in Paris, going on
to marry him on June 17, 1952. After several
naval postings, Consuelo and Bill settled in
Arlington and raised ﬁve children: Consuelo
L. Bangs, Karen L. Crow, Leslie L. Dilley, Cath-

STERN
VIRGINIA W. STERN
Virginia “Jinny” Waxman Stern, a pioneer-
ing advocate for people with disabilities in
science and technology, died peacefully on
December 6, 2025 in Washington, DC, sur-
rounded by her four children. She was 91.
For more than three decades, beginning in
the mid-1970s, Jinny was a driving force on
the Project on Science, Technology and Dis-
ability at the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), in Wash-
ington. She worked tirelessly to expand
opportunities and resources for people with
disabilities and their families, educators, and
employers in science, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics (STEM). Her efforts
fueled wider acceptance and advancement
of people with disabilities in scientiﬁc and
technological pursuits worldwide.
Recognizing that talented students with dis-
abilities needed more than legislation and
academic credentials to gain employment in
their chosen ﬁelds, Jinny founded the ﬂag-
ship “Entry Point!” program at AAAS in 1996
to secure paid internships for hundreds of
students with disabilities seeking to develop
STEM skills and career experiences in both
the private and public sectors. In 2012, the
White House under President Barack Obama
honored Jinny for her work as a Champion
of Change.
While at AAAS, Jinny also created and led
its Art of Science and Technology Program,
further enhancing public engagement with
science and technology. She curated and
displayed the work of local and interna-
tional artists depicting scientiﬁc themes,
making art an integral part of the everyday
workplace at AAAS.
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 27, 1934,
Jinny moved with her family to Scarsdale,
New York in 1940, and later to San Francis-
co, California in 1947. Jinny received a de-
gree in art history from Stanford University
in 1955. While in San Francisco, Jinny met
her husband Robert “Bob” Stern, a chemical
engineer from MIT pursuing a career in sci-
ence and technology policy. Married in 1956,
the couple had four children, Adam, Ami,
Mark, and Rachel, and ultimately settled in
Washington, DC.
Jinny’s work as an advocate for people with
disabilities began when her son Mark be-
came deaf at age one due to spinal menin-
gitis. Jinny sought out experts to learn more
about deafness and then earned a master’s
degree in deaf education from Gallaudet
University in 1971. She connected with and
helped many families with deaf children
through her professional work at the Lexing-
ton School for the Deaf in New York, and her
volunteer efforts for the Alexander Graham
Bell Association for the Deaf in Washington.
The Stern family home was a place of hos-
pitality, friendship and connection, featuring
frequent lunches and dinners with neigh-
bors, friends, diplomats, students, and visi-
tors from around the world. Over four de-
cades, Jinny rented out a spare bedroom to
interns and young professionals working in
DC, offering them not just a place to live, but
also support, guidance, and always engag-
ing discussions.
Jinny traveled widely, starting with her col-
lege junior year abroad in Florence, Italy. She
and Bob traveled often, visiting Europe, Isra-
el, Costa Rica, and India, and hiking in New
Zealand, Bhutan, and Nepal. They developed
a special fondness for Kitty Hawk and the
Outer Banks of North Carolina, which be-
came the family’s summer vacation destina-
tion for more than 50 years.
Jinny loved the city of Washington: the
monuments and memorials for the val-
ues they immortalize, Rock Creek Park for
bringing nature into daily life, the Metro for
connecting cultures and communities, and
the ringing bells of the National Cathedral,
which she could hear from her kitchen ta-
ble. She especially appreciated going to
ﬁne art galleries, and enjoyed a variety of
performing arts throughout the Washington
area, and supported their programs. Jinny
and Bob were longtime members of Temple
Sinai. They were also among the founders
and dedicated members of the Cleveland
& Woodley Park Village, a volunteer service
organization that helps seniors age in their
own homes.
Jinny is predeceased by her beloved hus-
band, Robert L. Stern, of nearly 65 years. She
is survived by her four children, Adam (Tia
Rich), Ami S. Gordon (Jonathan), Mark (Car-
olyn) and Rachel S. Davis (Derek); and seven
grandchildren, Sasha, Max (Diana), Zachary,
Abby, Grace, Anna and Charlie.
Donations can be made in her memory to
the Cleveland and Woodley Park Village, P.O.
Box 11231, Washington, DC 20008 (www.
cwpv.org), or to the Sibley Memorial Hospi-
tal Foundation, 5255 Loughboro Road NW,

ordic candy was almost inescapable for Maddie Langlois.
Anytime she opened TikTok last year, she encountered sweets of 
all shapes and sizes from the new York shop BonBon. It had tiny 
strawberry squids, various types of sour fish, foam skulls and 
raspberry puckers. soon enough, other confectionery companies — including 
swedish brand Bubs and the Los Angeles-based sockerbit — began swarming 
social media. nearly all of these candy enterprises sourced their sweets from 
europe.
This was good news for Langlois, 26, who had long been self-conscious 
about preferring gummies to chocolate. “In my mind, gummy candy is 
immature,” said Langlois, who works as a publicist in Boston. “I felt like 
chocolate was more widely acceptable. so, when gummies were like popping 
off, I was like, ‘oh, sweet, I need one of these stores near us, so I can go in and 
get all this gummy candy that I want to try.’”

Recently, your timeline might 
have been peppered with news 
stories about food influencers 
behaving badly. Most dramatical-
ly, a woman was arrested in 
Brooklyn for serial dining and 
dashing, after she refused to pay 
for luxurious meals around the 
Williamsburg neighborhood be-
cause she said she was reviewing 
them on Instagram. And a Phoe-
nix-area bakery owner in octo-
ber found herself in a public 
back-and-forth with a woman 
who had given her pastries a bad 
review after the bakery declined 
to comp her food.
These cases might have some 
restaurants feeling wary and 
normal diners who expect to pay 
their own way irritated, but 
many in the restaurant and influ-
encer world say they’re hardly 
the norm. Influencers have large-
ly become just another part of 
the ecosystem, with diners rely-
ing on them for tips on where to 
get the best martini and fries in 
town and restaurants counting 
on them to reach younger cus-

There’s a lot to love about cab-
bage. It’s affordable, nutritious, 
long-lasting, versatile and deli-
cious. It’s always there for you, 
any time of the year, which is 
especially helpful in the colder 
months, when there are limited 
produce options.
Cabbage comes in a variety of 
shapes and shades, and its flavor 
can be bitter and/or sweet, de-
pending on the type. Although 
the most common variety is the 
pale-green globe in produce aisles 
across the country, that’s just one 
of many out in the world. There’s 
red cabbage (really more of a deep 
magenta in color), which tends to 
be firmer than green and a tad 
more pungent, but the two are 
otherwise 
interchangeable. 
(When cooking with red cabbage, 
adding acid prevents it from turn-
ing an off-putting blue-gray col-
or.)

ner than the standard green and

Ingredients
l 2 tablespoons extra-virgin
olive oil
l One (16-ounce) package shelf-
stable potato gnocchi
l 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
l 20 fresh sage leaves
l 1 lemon, finely zested and cut
into wedges
l Grated parmesan cheese, for
serving
l Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon,
for serving
l Freshly ground black pepper,
for serving
Steps
l In a large (12-inch) nonstick or
cast-iron skillet over medium-
high heat, heat the oil until
shimmering. Add the gnocchi,
breaking apart any pieces that
are stuck together, and cook,
stirring occasionally, until gold-
en and browned in spots, 3 to 4
minutes. Transfer to a serving
bowl or individual bowls.
l In a small to medium (8-to-10-
inch) stainless-steel (or other
light-colored material) skillet
over medium heat, melt the
butter. (You can also use a
medium [3-to-4-quart] sauce-
pan.) Cook, stirring or swirling
the pan frequently, until the
milk solids turn a light golden
brown and the butter smells
nutty, about 3 minutes. Add the
sage leaves, and fry until they
start to curl and crisp, 20 to 30
seconds. Remove from the heat,
and pour the mixture over the
gnocchi. Sprinkle with the lem-
on zest, parmesan, flaky salt
and pepper. Serve hot, with
lemon wedges for squeezing
over.

and woodsy, with a touch of
freshness that some liken to
citrus, eucalyptus or mint.
Browning butter is simple to
do but requires a watchful eye
and keen senses. “Butter is a
matrix of fat, water, proteins and
sugars,” recipes editor Becky
Krystal wrote on the subject.
When it is exposed to heat, the
water is driven off, and what
remains starts to evolve, creating
new aromas and flavor
compounds. “Use your eyes, ears
and nose. The bubbling and
crackling … followed by silence
means the water has been cooked
off and it’s time to pay even closer
attention as the solids brown.”
As much as I dislike asking you
to do this, you’ll want a separate
pan for this step — one with a
light interior, such as stainless
steel, so you can more readily see
the color transform. Just seconds
before the butter is ready, add the
sage leaves to fry until they curl
and crisp. Then you want to
immediately take the skillet off
the heat and pour the butter and
sage over the seared gnocchi to
keep the butter from burning.
There’s a very fine line between
deliciousness and disaster.
To finish, top the dish with
flaky sea salt, black pepper,
parmesan cheese and lemon zest,
and serve with lemon wedges on
the side. These accoutrements
really make the dish sing by
adding flavor and balance to each
bite, with the cheese enhancing
the savory nuttiness of the brown
butter and the lemon’s brightness
keeping it from feeling too heavy.
I found myself going back
again and again until I ended up
eating the whole platter. It’s a
meal worth celebrating on its
own — and one that can help you
commemorate life’s best
moments, too.

From staff writer Aaron Hutch-
erson.
How was your
2025? For many,
myself included, it
was fairly
tumultuous.
There was work
stress, anxiety
about my family’s
health and
sadness about
world events. But
there were bright
spots, too, including awe-
inspiring concerts; trips to
different cities and countries;
and deepening friendships over
card games, meals and dancing
until the wee hours.
In any given year, there’s
always reason to celebrate, even
if it’s just the fact that you made
it through. So to bid farewell to
the old and ring in the new, we’re
making brown butter and fried
sage leaves to pour over pan-
seared gnocchi — a meal that
feels festive and extravagant but
takes only 20 minutes to prepare.
It starts with store-bought
gnocchi that get cooked in a
nonstick or cast-iron skillet until
brown and crisp on the outside,
though they retain a slight chew
for a variety of textures. It’s a
technique I shared last summer
(wapo.st/3YcejFk), and I am once
again asking you to try it for
yourself if you haven’t already.
(You are certainly welcome to
make your own potato or ricotta
gnocchi if you’re in the mood for
more of a project during the
holiday week.)
Brown butter and fried sage
are classic partners for gnocchi.
(If you’re not a fan of the potato
dumplings for whatever reason,
you could pour brown butter and
sage on any type of pasta and it
would be delicious.) The butter is
nutty with notes of caramel,
while the sage is earthy, savory

Baechu Doenjang Guk (Cabbage and Doenjang
Soup)
4 servings (makes 8 cups)
This vegan soup, known as baechu doenjang guk in Korean, is hearty
with cabbage and tofu. Mushrooms, soy sauce and doenjang (a
fermented soy paste) give the broth a deep, complex flavor. Adapted
from “The Korean Vegan: Homemade” by Joanne Lee Molinaro, the
dish is described as a mellow, soothing, stewlike soup, something to
lean on when you’re feeling “a little blue or a little tired.” It’s simple,
fortifying and warming.
Storage: Refrigerate for up to 4 days.
Where to buy: Doenjang can be found at Asian markets and online.
Total time: 35 mins
Adapted from “The Korean Vegan: Homemade” by Joanne Lee
Molinaro (Avery, 2025).
Ingredients
l 11/2 teaspoons olive oil
l 11/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
l 8 fresh shiitake mushrooms
(about 5 ounces), stems
removed, sliced
l 1 small yellow onion (5 ounces),
halved and thinly sliced
l 2 tablespoons doenjang, plus
more as needed (see Where to
buy)
l 4 cups vegetable broth,
preferably low-sodium, divided
l 1 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy
sauce, plus more as needed
l 4 large napa cabbage leaves, cut
into 1-inch chunks
l One (14-to-16-ounce) package
silken tofu, drained
Steps
l In a large Dutch oven, Korean

or
other
heavy-
bottomed
pot
over
medium
heat, heat the olive and sesame
oils until shimmering. Add the
mushrooms and onion, and sau-
té until fragrant and softened, 4
to 5 minutes. Stir in the doen-
jang until the vegetables are
evenly coated.
l Add 1 cup of the broth and the
soy sauce, and use a wooden
spoon to scrape up any browned
bits on the bottom of the pot.
Add the remaining 3 cups of
broth, increase the heat to medi-
um-high and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low
and simmer for 10 minutes, so
the flavors can meld.
l Stir in the cabbage, then use a
dinner spoon to break up the
block of tofu and scoop the piec-
es into the soup. Cook until the
cabbage is tender but not limp, 2
to 4 minutes. Taste, and stir in
more doenjang and soy sauce, if
desired. Ladle into bowls and
serve hot.

l Sesame oil >> olive or vegetable
oil.
l Shiitake mushrooms >> a mix of
different fresh mushrooms.
l Soy sauce >> gluten-free tamari

Doenjang is a fermented
soybean paste, similar to
Japanese miso but more deeply
savory and more pungent.
Molinaro included a recipe for
spicy doenjang chigae, a
traditional Korean stew flavored
with doenjang, in her first
cookbook. It’s a dish that she ate
countless times growing up but
that her mother avoided making
if a non-Korean was coming to
the house, because she worried
they’d be put off by the smell. In
a surprising twist, that recipe
was a hit among Molinaro’s
readers. “I’d spent so much of
my childhood being
embarrassed at the smell and
appearance of doenjang, and so
the surprising popularity of this
humble stew signaled to me
what I’d always suspected deep
down — despite all the
boundaries we’ve erected to
because they can be this easy,”
Molinaro told me. It’s an
instance of something simple
being more than the sum of its
parts. For Koreans like Molinaro,
it might also be a taste of
childhood: something
comforting and gentle, soothing
and warming — and just right
for right now.

divide us, we have far more in
common than we realize,”
Molinaro wrote. “We all just love
delicious food!”
Cooks know that most
delicious food takes time. In
Korean kitchens, one way to
speed things up is to use a long-
fermented paste, such as
doenjang, to give depth and
body to dishes that otherwise
would need more ingredients or
a longer cooking time. This
Baechu Doenjang Guk is a case
in point. It has just nine
ingredients and takes only 35
minutes.
Sesame oil, shiitake
mushrooms and yellow onion
lend their flavors to the broth,
but it’s the doenjang that acts as
a backbone, grounding

After weeks of

laden casseroles,
I’m in the mood
for meals that are
lighter but still
warming and
cozy. Baechu
Doenjang Guk, or
Cabbage and
Doenjang Soup as it’s called in
English, is Joanne Lee
Molinaro’s way of soothing her
mind and body.
Known to online audiences as
the Korean Vegan, Molinaro has
a new cookbook, “The Korean
Vegan: Homemade,” that is full
of easy but gratifying recipes. A
born storyteller, Molinaro invites
readers into her inner world in
her latest book, sharing deeply
personal remembrances from
her childhood and early
adulthood. After reading it, like
her other fans, I felt a
connection.
That connection helped me
make the leap from reading her
book to cooking from it. As I
flipped through the recipes, the
one for this soup stood out.
“Baechu Doenjang Guk is for
when you’re feeling a little blue
or a little tired. It will lift your
spirits with both its healing
properties (the cabbage is so
good for the tummy) and its
mouthwatering flavor,” she
wrote.
I called her to chat about how
she created the dish. “Personally,
I was having stomach problems
at the time, and I had read that
something that could help with
stomach issues was cabbage, so I
started cooking with a lot of
cabbage,” she told me. “I
remembered this Korean recipe
with cabbage and doenjang. I
had just been talking to a friend
who’s a total foodie about where
you draw the line between guk
and chigae, soup and stew. I
knew I wanted this to be a soup.
One distinction is that there’s
not too much protein … so it’s
meant to be easy on the tummy
and curative.”
Molinaro originally used
standard green cabbage here,
and although that worked well,
she decided to try it with the
cabbage Koreans have been
using for centuries. “I thought it
was okay with regular cabbage,
but when I used napa cabbage, it
felt like it came to life for me,”
Molinaro said. “This soup is
soothing both physically but also
mentally for me. The flavor of
doenjang is the most comforting
flavor in my culinary vocabulary.
It’s the flavor I go back to when
something is really tough.”

The posts and videos that 
compensated influencers pro-
duce, unsurprisingly, are largely 
positive.
Unpaid reviews can some-
times skew more negative, such 
as the drags of Atlanta’s dining 
scene dished out by uber-influ-
encer Keith Lee, who takes pains 
to avoid being recognized and 
given special treatment.
ricky Ly (@tastychomps), an 
orlando-based influencer who 
highlights local restaurants and 
food businesses and often fea-
tures Asian-owned establish-
ments, says he’s not interested in 
sharing negative reviews with his 
audience. “If it’s not good, I try 
not to talk about them, ’cause I 
don’t want to kick anyone while 
they’re down,” he said.
Ly, who started out as a food 
blogger in 2008 and has shifted 
his focus to videos and social 
media, has more than 72,000 
followers on Instagram, which 
puts him in the category of 
small-to-midsize 
influencer. 
Some of his posts are paid, and 
others he does free, in the name 
of helping local businesses and 
keeping his page as a source for 
recommendations that his view-
ers can trust, he said. recently, 
he got a call from a new filipino 
bakery asking whether he’d like 
to come try its wares. “They just 
started out, so I’m not going to 
charge them,” he said. And it 
ended up “working out well for 
everybody,” he said. The post did 
well, 
clocking 
more 
than 
400,000 views across platforms, 
and it drove business to the 
bakery, which sold out after be-
ing featured.
Growing up, his father owned 
an Asian market and a Japanese 
restaurant in South florida. “I 
always wished more people knew 
about them,” said Ly, who has 
kept his day job as an engi-
neer and does not plan to make 
content creation his full-time 
profession. “And I don’t know if 
[tastychomps] came from that, 
but maybe I’ve always been try-
ing to spread the word and also 
connect 
community 
through 
food and through the media 
to help people find places that 
maybe they’ve never tried be-
fore.”
Kate finley, the founder of 
Belle Communication who con-
sults with restaurants on their 
social media strategy, says she 
advises clients to be as explicit as 
possible. 
“Communication 
is 
key,” she said. “You can’t leave it 
open-ended.”
for many restaurateurs, sim-
ply not doing business with influ-
encers is no longer an option. 
“At this point, you can’t have 
your head in the sand or dig your 
heels in on no influencers,” fin-
ley said. “It’s like saying, ‘I don’t 
want the local news media to 
cover me.’ It’s just not smart 
business.”
To younger consumers, a per-
son they follow on social media 
and feel connected to might 
seem like a more reliable source 
of information than advertising, 
online sources such as Yelp re-
views, or traditional media cov-
erage. “Influencers make them-
selves really relatable, and the 
viewers are able to identify with 
them, which creates a really 
strong parasocial relationship,” 
said Linda Dam, a professor at 
the University of Nevada at Las 
Vegas who studies food influenc-
ers. “research has indicated that 
if you do have that strong rela-
tionship, you’re more likely to 
have better brand attitudes and 
intentions to either purchase the 
food or consume the food that 
they do.”
Which means that relatability 
— or the biggest buzzword in the 
social media realm, authenticity 
— is prized on both sides of the 
deal. That’s what rina rapuano 
is looking for when vetting social 
media accounts for the D.C. res-
taurants she handles Pr for, 
including Italian hot spot L’Ar-
dente. She said she is more likely 
to seek out influencers who have 
already expressed an organic 
(a.k.a. uncompensated) interest 
in the restaurant.
And mostly, the interactions — 
usually agreed to and scheduled 
well in advance of a visit — go 
according to plan.
John Winterman, the owner of 
the michelin-starred francie in 
Brooklyn, one of the restaurants 
hit up by the now-notorious 
dine-and-dasher Pei-Yun Chung, 
estimates that he gets three to 
five requests every week from 
influencers looking to visit fran-
cie and post about it in exchange 
either for a comped meal or, 
sometimes, a fee. He turns al-
most all of them down, but when 
his restaurant does invite one in, 
they know what they are in for.
“You have to be very discern-
ing about who you’re going to let 
into your world,” he said in an 
interview. “Lots of feeds out 
there, they have a few thousand 
followers, and they’ve got pic-
tures of, like, rainbow-colored 
bagels, and, all due respect to 
that sort of thing, that’s not really 
going to represent our product 
that well.”
Unlike in earlier days of influ-
encer culture, interactions be-
tween content creators and the 
businesses they promote are typ-
ically professionalized, some-
times involving detailed con-
tracts. In most cases, the terms 
are at least spelled out in an 
email or a direct conversation. 
on one side, there’s what a 
restaurant might offer: a comped 
meal, possibly from a limited 
selection of menu items; whether 
there’s a limit on drinks or items 
ordered; and whether the influ-
encer is expected to tip. on the 
other side, there’s what the visit-
ing social media figure will pro-
vide, possibly spelling out the 
number of posts or stories, and 
whether the restaurant can use 
the content on their own plat-
forms.
inFluEnCERS from E1
Restaurants, creators 
say most interactions 
are business as usual
“A lot of it comes from love for 
the brand that preexists before 
they post about it in a partner-
ship.”
rapuano said her restaurants 
usually don’t work with written 
contracts, but by the time an 
influencer gets an invite, she’s 
familiar enough with the kind of 
posts and the influencer’s per-
sonality and style to know what 
to expect.
brands such as mcDonald’s will 
want to work with people who 
have already declared them-
selves to be fans.
“We’ve had so many sponsor-
ships that have come from a 
brand seeing an organic post and 
either paying for a future post, or 
saying ‘We love your review on 
this item, and would you be open 
to us buying the video rights and 
putting it in an ad?’” rosen said. 
“The influencers that we like 
to work with are the ones who 
are highly engaged, the ones who 
interact with our content or we 
interact 
with 
their 
content 
throughout the year, even when 
they’re not visiting,” she said.
on a larger scale, national 
chains often take the same ap-
proach. Jake rosen, an agent 
who represents influencers in 
deals with brands, says major

loose, deep-green leaves.
regardless of the variety you 
pick up, there’s lots that cabbage 
can do. Here’s how to make the 
most of the beloved vegeta-
ble. recipes whose names are 
capitalized can be found at 
wapo.st/recipes.
Raw
for starters, cabbages can be 
enjoyed without any heat applied. 
Although they can keep in the 
refrigerator for weeks, it’s best to 
use them within a few days if you 
plan to eat them raw. Standard 
green and red cabbages tend to be 
tougher and boast a bigger 
crunch compared with napa and 
Savoy, which are more tender. No 
matter the variety, you want to 
thinly slice or finely chop cabbage 
when including it in raw applica-
tions to avoid having to chew 
forever.
Napa cabbage is included in 
the mix in Wolfgang Puck’s Chi-
nois Chicken Salad. former 
Washington Post copy editor Jim 
Webster made a vegetarian ver-
sion with even more cabbage in 
his orange and Cashew Cabbage 
Salad With Sesame Dressing. for 
a salad with fewer ingredients 
that is still full of flavor, there’s 
Cabbage Salad With Tahini and 
miso.
Perhaps the most common use 
for raw cabbage is in slaws of 
various types, such as Tri-Cab-
bage Coleslaw or red Cabbage 
and fennel Slaw With Sunflower 
Seeds. If you’re making it in ad-
vance, it’s a good idea to salt the 
cabbage ahead of time so you can 
get rid of some of the moisture to 
prevent your slaw from becoming 
watery.
Fermented and pickled
Various preservation methods 
are used with cabbage in cuisines 
around the world. There’s Classic 
Sauerkraut, the tangy, Central 
European staple. There’s sunny 
and bright Cambodian-Style Cab-
bage Pickle, which includes chile, 
ginger, garlic and lemongrass. 
And one of my favorites: Napa 
Cabbage Kimchi from Korea, with 
its kick of spice from gochugaru 
(Korean chile flakes). All are ex-
cellent as condiments, ingredi-
ents in other recipes, or side dish-
es or snacks on their own.

stacking pans to give a little 
more insulation on the bottom.

Q: I’m thinking of giving jars of 
spiced nuts as gifts to my 
friends. Any tips or tried-and-
true recipes?
A: I made a version of our 
Maple Spiced Glazed Nuts to 
use in my Farro and Pumpkin 
Soup With Spiced Maple Pecans. 
I’m also a fan of recipes that call 
for an egg white. We also have 
Maple-Bacon Spiced Nuts on

old blog (bit.ly/4pga32I) for

cool things down and allow 
you to scrape up any browned 
bits.

Q: I line my baking sheets with 
parchment paper and faithfully 
watch the oven temperature/
minutes the cookies are baking. 
Still, the bottom of my cookies 
burn more often than not. I 
suspect it has something to do 
with the baking sheet (or type of 
baking sheet) I am using. (I also 
allow the sheet to cool before I 
use it again to bake.) I once used 
a perforated pizza pan and had 
better luck. Will try it again, but 
any thoughts or 
recommendations?
A: I suspect the sheet pan is a 
good hunch, but you didn’t tell 
me what yours are! Aluminum/
steel, such as what is made by 
Nordic Ware, is my preferred 
my Le Creuset. The heat has to 
be high enough to brown, but 
because the process takes a 
while, at some point, the fond 
starts getting dark and maybe 
even smoking. Once I decided I 
had to clean the pot in between 
batches for fear of adding a 
burned flavor to the stew, which 
not only potentially removes 
flavor but also takes forever 
(Enameled cast iron doesn’t cool 
quickly.) Any suggestions?
A: What heat are you using? The 
Le Creusets do indeed get pretty 
hot, because cast iron is so 
efficient at retaining heat, so 
even if you’re starting at 
medium-high, there’s a good 
chance you either need to 
start lower or adjust down as 
time goes on. I usually have 
to on mine, anyway. A splash 
of water or whatever liquid is 
in the recipe can also help 
Q: I have a caramel sauce recipe 
that calls for 1 tablespoon of 
corn syrup to stabilize the 
mixture as it cooks and to 
minimize the chance of 
graininess, I think. Could I use 
golden syrup instead? It’s in my 
cabinet, and I’d hate to go buy a 
bottle of Karo for essentially a 
single use. Is it the syrup-ness or 
the ingredient of corn that 
matters?
A: I think the golden syrup 
should be fine there. It’s not the 
corn that matters; it’s the liquid 
sugar. These types of sugars — 
either invert sugar, partial 
invert sugars or ingredients 
similar to invert sugars — can 
help prevent crystallization.

Q: How do I oven-bake simple 
chicken for salads? And how do 
I incorporate goat cheese as a 
potential co-star ingredient in 
my salads? It doesn’t crumble, 
and if I throw it on a salad 
straight off the log, it just 
becomes a smear on a few 
leaves.
A: Assuming you’re referring to 
boneless, skinless chicken 
breasts, my go-to method is 
listed in our recipe for Wolfgang 
Puck’s Chinois Chicken Salad. 
Season the chicken with salt 
and pepper, brown it in a 
stainless-steel skillet, then 
finish it in a 350-degree oven. 
Some grocery stores sell pre-
crumbled goat cheese that you 
can just sprinkle on your 
salad. If using a log, use your 
fingers to tear it into pieces as 
best as you can to add to your 
salad.

Q: My friend bakes exclusively 
with Kerrygold butter. Although 
I’ve used European-style butter 
such as Plugrà for kouign-
amann, for my cookie baking, I 
use store-brand unsalted butter. 
Would my cookies taste better 
with a higher-fat butter like 
Kerrygold?
A: Not necessarily. It may not 
even work with your particular 
recipes. High-fat butters can be 
great for laminated pastries, but 
because they are just that — 
higher in fat — they tend to 
have less water, which can cause 
problems, too. There might be 
some cases where the swap 
would work — perhaps a buttery 
shortbread — but I think that, 
overall, the safer (not to 
mention cheaper) option is to 
stick with regular supermarket 
butter.

thing was new. of course, Bubs 
and Squashies I had seen from 
TikTok. But all the other options I 
really wasn’t familiar with.”
In these stores, sweets are pre-
sented as a conduit to the custom-
er’s inner child. Schaltz said that 
he has a touch of Peter Pan syn-
drome, which is how BonBon 
came up with its tagline: “Grow-
ing up is a trap.” After all, it’s hard 
for customers to be upset about 
work or politics or parenting 
when they’re considering whether 
to purchase marshmallow squeez-
es or tart gummies.
Some of these shops don’t ex-
clusively carry European candy. 
But a broader selection of treats 
brought Gearhart right back to 
her childhood when she first went 
to madeleine’s. “Walking in there, 
seeing ones like sour Airhead belts 
— something that I remember 
having at summer camp when I 
was a kid — is really nostalgic,” she 
said.
The demand for higher-quality 
candy also helps. Several treat 
slingers noted that customers are 
intrigued by European health reg-
ulations, where ingredients such 
as titanium dioxide and potassi-
um bromate, which can be found 
in some fruity candies, are 
banned. These stricter rules ap-
peal to the mAHA-curious who 
stop into the stores.
“There’s something to be said 
about the health movement that’s 
happening in America on TikTok 
and social media,” said Bradburn, 
adding that the use of natural dyes 
and the lack of high-fructose corn 
syrup or red dye No. 40 in Nordic 
candies “has also played a part in 
people being intrigued by it.”
Nearly all of the shop owners 
The Post spoke with mentioned 
that, just after opening, they had 
to quickly place additional orders 
or close because they sold out of 
European candies. A few spots — 
Lil Sweet Treat, So Swede and 
BonBon — have plans to expand, 
while others are just trying to keep 
up with the demand of a single 
location.
“I don’t need to have 17 loca-
tions,” said madeleine Brason, the 
founder of madeleine’s Candy 
Shop. “I want to be that nostalgic 
neighborhood local store that 
hopefully has longevity.”
Integrating madeleine’s into 
the surrounding community in 
Boston was always part of Brason’s 
plan. otherwise, she fears, these 
candy stores might go the way of 
the frozen yogurt boom. Even if 
retail is struggling, the brick-and-
mortar shops help candy become a 
place for people to connect, ac-
cording to shop owners.
“It’s a lot harder to do that over 
e-commerce, because it’s a little bit 
more transactional,” said ross, 
who worked in tech before found-
ing Lil Sweet Treat. “There’s no 
way for two old best friends to 
meet up and make an activity of 
creating a candy bag.”
The remarkable staying power 
of those colorful Swedish candies 
was a shock to madison Banks, 25, 
who thought “we would move on 
to maybe a different nationality or 
a different niche” by now. But 
hearing that So Swede was regu-
larly selling out of sweets this sum-
mer, Banks decided to drop by the 
shop, where the continued success 
began to click.
“Everyone was in there, gather-
ing around these jars of candy, 
talking about what they wanted.”
For candy lovers in the U.S., 
Nordic sweet shops are a treat

Many of the new candy stores use a pick-and-mix setup, including the Lil Sweet Treat location in d.c.’s Georgetown neighborhood.

The surge in popularity has prompted several boutique shops to quickly place additional orders or close because they sold out of candies. 
She got her wish. This year, a 
handful of stores that stock Nordic 
candies opened in Boston, begin-
ning in february with madeleine’s 
Candy Shop. They’re part of a larg-
er wave of boutique, social-media-
friendly 
shops 
cropping 
up 
around the country off the back of 
the viral Swedish candy craze.
In 2024, Elly ross opened a 
quaint West Village shop called Lil 
Sweet Treat, before rapidly adding 
six more locations in manhattan, 
Boston, Philadelphia and (as of 
last month) D.C. farther north, in 
Portland, maine, Nikoline oster-
gaard founded Sodt, alongside her 
mother and sister, after seeing 
that there was a market for treats 
from her native Denmark. In 
Utah, the two co-founders of a 
Swedish-inspired clothing brand 
brought some Nordic sweets to a 
pop-up event. Seeing the fervor 
that the candy caused, malia Brad-
burn, olive redd and Greta Sun-
derlage decided to open So Swede 
in an extra office space.
These shops bring Nordic 
sweets into the neighborhoods of 
online candy connoisseurs. But in-
side the shops, the line blurs be-
tween the digital sphere and reali-
ty: With bright wallpapers, cute 
baggies and the pick-and-mix set-
ups, these stores are playgrounds 
for those making TikTok videos 
and Instagram posts.
It’s that sleek, fancy feel that 
defines many of these shops, in-
cluding madeleine’s Candy Shop, 
which “feels like you’re at like a 
boutique clothing store or a bou-
tique grocery store,” according to 
marina Gearhart, 31, who first en-
countered madeleine’s while look-
ing for a specific elderflower fish 
candy from BonBon. “The wallpa-
per in there feels like a hotel. They 
really know what they’re doing.”
That emphasis on elevating 
candy culture comes from Scandi-
navia, where a weekly dose of can-
dy for kids is as standard as recess. 
Leo Schaltz, one of BonBon’s co-
founders, remembers biking to 
pick up sweets for lordagsgodis, a 
Swedish and Norwegian tradition 
where children eat candy only on 
Saturdays. “To a Swede, going to 
buy your candy on Saturday is the 
closest thing we have to a religious 
tradition,” he said.
Sweets shops are, of course, not 
exclusive to Europe. Across Amer-
ica, penny candy shops used to be 
well-represented at general stores 
and apothecaries, on boardwalks 
and in vacation towns. often fea-
turing specific, locally made 
treats, many of them began to 
close because of corporate consoli-
dation or because the candy man-
ufacturers moved overseas be-
tween the 1970s and ’90s, accord-
ing to Sasha Zabar, who owns Gla-
ce Candy in manhattan and whose 
family runs Zabar’s.
“A lot of the smaller-scale candy 
businesses became co-packers 
and manufacturers for nutraceu-
ticals, like vitamin gummies and 
also THC-related stuff as well,” 
Zabar said. “There’s not a lot of 
companies that make candy any-
more, especially in the U.S.”
These new European-inspired 
shops are just the latest in a long 
history of upscale sweet spots, ac-
cording to Susan Benjamin, a can-
dy historian and the founder of the 
True Treats store. In contrast to 
inexpensive, 
corner-store-type 
shops, Benjamin notes a long his-
tory of posh places selling bon-
bons and truffles or advertising 
french-style chocolates. made-
leine’s and Lil Sweet Treat are 
among the latest places to capital-
ize on Americans’ curiosity about 
European snacks.
“Even though they may not 
know it, they’re going back to the 
old model of candy being special, 
where you get a sample when you 
go in a candy store on a little silver 
plate and you try a little bit, or 
where it’s got special lighting,” 
Benjamin said. “It’s almost like a 
jewelry store, the way they used to 
do it.”
for the candy fans The Wash-
ington Post spoke to for this story, 
the polished look of these stores 
doesn’t hurt, but the thrill is 
around the novelty: different fla-
vors, chewy textures and a free-
dom to buy whatever amount they 
want through the mix-and-match 
system. Christine oh, a 36-year-
old intensive care unit nurse who 
lives near Sodt in maine, said it’s 
about trying something that she 
had previously seen only online.
“There’s definitely plenty to 
choose from, but it wasn’t too 
much,” oh said about Sodt’s cozy

232 F.R.D. 263, 264 (E.D. Va. 2005) (quoting Rio Props., Inc. v. Rio Int’/ 
Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1015 (9th Cir. 2002)); see DAG Ammo Corp. 
v. KM Trade do.o., 3:21-cv-332, 2021 WL 7933706, at *l (E.D. Va. June 
4, 2021). “The only limitations on Rule 4(f)(3) are that the means of
service must be directed by the court and must not be prohibited
by international agreement.” Dagra, 232 F.R.D. at 264. Additionally, to 
“fulﬁll due process requirements under Rule 4(£)(3), the Court must
approve a method of service that is ‘reasonably calculated’ to give no-
tice to defendant.” Id. (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust 
Co., 339 U.S. 306,314 (1950)); see Overstock.com, Inc. v. Visocky, 1:17-
cv-1331, 2018 WL 5075511, at *4 (E.D. Va. Aug. 23, 2018), report and 
recommendation adopted, 2018 WL 5046673 (E.D. Va. Oct. 17, 2018) 
(service via email on foreign defendant is “reasonably calculated” to 
provide notice).
Here, Plaintiff’s proposal  for  service  by  publication  satisﬁes  the 
requirements  of Rule 4(£)(3). First, all Defendants named in this action 
are in Iraq and Iraq is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on
the Service of Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil 
or Commercial Matters (the “Hague Convention”).2 The Court is not 
otherwise aware of any international agreement that would prohibit 
Plaintiffs proposed means of service.
Second, Plaintiff has been diligent in attempting to effectuate service 
and “has little to no options left to obtain service” other than alter-
native means like publication. FMAC Loan Receivables v. Dagra, 228 
F.R.D. 531, 533, 535- 36 (E.D. Va. 2005). Speciﬁcally,  where many of the 
Defendants are allegedly “internationally-recognized terrorists and 
their co-conspirators,”
Plaintiff has expended considerable resources on investigators to de-
termine the physical locations in Iraq where these Defendants may be 
located. (Dkt. No. 20 ,r,r 8-9) (Plaintiffs Declaration in Support oﬂssuing 
Summons.)   Plaintiff then engaged  a private  process server who
attempted to
personally serve ten defendants in Iraq, but each time, the process
server was met with “armed security  guards,” instructed “to not
come back for any reason,” and the process server ultimately
refused to continue to attempt service on the remaining defendants 
because he feared he would be harmed.  (Dkt. No. 33-2 ,r 2-6  (Sworn 
Declaration from Process Server); see also Dkt. No. 33-3
,r,r 2-14 (Sworn  Declaration  from Chief Executive  Ofﬁcer  of Process 
Server).)   Based on the
Court’s review of the sworn declarations submitted in support of the 
Motion, personal service on Defendants reasonably appears to be in-
feasible at this time.
Third, service by publication satisﬁes Rule 4’s due process require-
ments because publication in Plaintiffs proposed outlets is reasonably 
calculated to notify Defendants of this action. As a threshold matter, 
where Defendants all appear to reside in Iraq, it would be preferable 
to publish notice of this action in Iraqi newspapers, however Plaintiff 
has represented that “various
major national newspapers in Iraq ... refused  to publish notice of the 
suit out of fear of reprisal by Defendants.” (Dkt. No. 33-1 ,r 4) (Plain-
tiffs Declaration in Support of Alternative Service.) Therefore,  Plaintiff 
seeks to  publish  notice: (i) in “an  English-language newspaper  of 
general
circulation” such as The New York Times; (ii) in “an Arabic-language 
newspaper of general circulation,” such as Al-Quds Al Arabiya, Asharq 
Al-Awsat, Azzaman, or Al-Arab; and (iii) on GlobalLegalNotices.com.” 
(See Dkt. No. 33-10) (Plaintiffs Proposed Order.) In support of publi-
cation  in those outlets, Plaintiff submits the sworn declaration ofN. 
Tucker, who represents that he has “decades of experience in coordi-
nating international service of process, including in the Middle East,” 
and based on that expertise, his “professional opinion” is that “the
best method of service” is Plaintiff’s proposed newspapers and Glob-
alLegalNotice.com. (Dkt. No. 33-3 ,i,i 15- 16.) Indeed, this Court has
found that “it is clear that service by publication to a defendant in a 
foreign country is an acceptable alternative means under 4(f)(3).” BP 
Prods. N Am., Inc. v. Dagra, 236 F.R.D. 270, 271-72 (E.D. Va. 2006) (au-
thorizing service via publication in two Pakistani newspapers because 
those were “general-subject newspapers with wide circulation in the 
area of [the defendants’] last-known whereabouts”); see also Oralie
Supplies Inc. v. Huang, 3:22-cv- 00623 (E.D. Va. Jan. 26, 2023), Dkt. 12 
(allowing alternative service by publication via GlobalLegalNotices.
com where plaintiff could not ﬁnd a printed publication that would
publish notice of the case); Kumer v. Hezbollah, 2023 WL 3867301,
at *4 (E.D.N.Y. June 7, 2023) (granting motion to effectuate service by 
radio and news media on Hezbollah, a defendant here); Miller v. Cartel, 
2020 WL 12969219, at *2 (D.N.D. Sept. I 8, 2020) (authorizing service by 
publication on a drug cartel) (collecting cases).
Accordingly, it is hereby
ORDERED that the Motion, (Dkt. No. 33), is GRANTED. It is further
ORDERED that Plaintiff serve the Amended Complaint, summons, and 
this Order on Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
4(f)(3) and (h)(2) by doing the following:

and
3. Publishing notice of the suit, including a copy of this Order, online 
for a period of four weeks at GlobalLegal otices.com, via Global Legal

ty-ﬁve (45) days after the entry of this Order describing  the steps  that 
have  been  taken  to comply with this Order, including whether any

Defendants are hereby notiﬁed that a complaint has been ﬁled against 
thembunder the Anti- Terrorism Act (“ATA”), 18 U.S.C. § 2333 and the

The property is believed to be improved by a 13-story commercial ofﬁce building. The 
gross building area is believed to be approximately 226,000 square feet.  The information 
contained herein has been obtained from sources deemed reliable and is believed to be 
accurate.  However, no express or implied warranty is made or may be inferred from any such 
information.  Prospective purchasers are encouraged to perform their own due diligence, in 
advance of the auction regarding the Property.
FIXTURES
Pursuant to the Deed of Trust, Beneﬁciary holds a security interest and lien on all of the 
tangible and intangible assets of Debtor and will sell at public auction on the same date 
and at the same time and place, ALL OF THE FIXTURES of Debtor located on or about the 
Real Estate (that is subject to the security interest and lien of Beneﬁciary and not owned 
by any third party).
TOGETHER WITH any and all buildings, structures, improvements or appurtenances now 
erected on the Real Estate, including, without limitation, all equipment, apparatus, 
machinery and ﬁxtures of any kind or character forming a part of said buildings, structures, 
improvements or appurtenances and located in, upon or about the Real Estate and any 
buildings thereon all as more particularly described in the Deed of Trust (the foregoing, 
together with the Real Estate is collectively, the “Property”). The “Property” does not include 
any property owned by any tenants at the Property.
TERMS OF SALE: ALL CASH. The Property will be offered as an entirety only. The bid that yields 
the highest price for the Property will be accepted by the Substitute Trustees (unless the sale 
is postponed or cancelled) and all bids will be provisional until acceptance.  Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the Substitute Trustees absolutely reserve the right to postpone the sale and/
or cancel the sale at any time until the auctioneer announces that the Property is “sold” 
and the deposit in the required amount and form is received by the Substitute Trustees. 
A deposit in the amount of $1,000,000 will be required at the time of sale as a condition 
to bidding. Such deposit must be by cashier’s check or certiﬁed check or in such other 
form as the Substitute Trustees may determine in their sole discretion. The deposit must be 
increased to 5% of the purchase price within 2 business days after completion of the sale, 
and delivered to the Substitute Trustees in the same form of funds as the initial deposit. 
In the event the successful purchaser fails to deliver the additional deposit as and when 
required, the initial deposit will be forfeited. Beneﬁciary (or any related party) shall be 
exempted by the Substitute Trustees from submitting any bidding deposit or, if they are 
the winning bidder, any additional deposit. The Substitute Trustees will, as a condition of 
the sale, require all potential bidders, except Beneﬁciary, to show their deposit before any 
bidding begins. The retained deposit of the successful purchaser shall be applied, without 
interest, to the successful purchaser’s credit at settlement; provided, however, that in the 
event the successful purchaser does not consummate the purchase in accordance with 
the terms of sale as herein provided, the entire deposit will be forfeited. The terms of sale 
must be complied with and settlement consummated thereon within 45 calendar days from 
the day of sale unless extended at the sole discretion of the Substitute Trustees. TIME IS 
OF THE ESSENCE. The balance of the purchase price over and above the retained deposit, 
with interest thereon at the rate then being charged under the note secured by the Deed of 
Trust, from the date of sale through the date of receipt of the balance of the purchase price, 
will be due at settlement by bank wire transfer; and if not so paid, the Substitute Trustees 
reserve the right to retain the entire deposit and resell the Property at the risk and cost of 
the defaulting purchaser, after such advertisement and on such terms as the Substitute 
Trustees may deem proper, and to avail themselves and Beneﬁciary of any legal or equitable 
rights against the defaulting purchaser.
The Property is sold subject to the rights, if any, of the Property’s tenants and/or parties in 
possession, if such rights have priority over the Deed of Trust, and to any and all covenants, 
conditions, restrictions, easements, rights of way and limitations of record and such facts 
as would be revealed by an accurate survey of the Property. The Property will be sold “WHERE 
IS” and in “AS IS” condition without any warranty as to condition, express or implied, and 
without any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the information furnished 
to prospective bidders by the Substitute Trustees or any other party, if any, and without 
any other representations or warranty of any nature. The Property will also be sold without 
any contingency for the successful purchaser to perform any due diligence investigation 
of the Property prior to settlement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the 
Property will be sold without representation or warranty as to (i) title to the Property, (ii) the 
nature, condition, structural integrity or ﬁtness for a particular use of any improvements or 
ﬁxtures included within the Property, (iii) the environmental condition of the Property or the 
compliance of the Property with federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning 
the presence or disposal of hazardous substances, (iv) compliance of the Property with the 
Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar law, or (v) compliance of the Property with 
any zoning laws or ordinances and any and all applicable safety codes, and acceptance of 
the Substitute Trustee’s deed to the Property by the successful purchaser shall constitute 
a waiver of any and all claims against the Substitute Trustees and Beneﬁciary concerning 
any of the foregoing matters. The successful purchaser recognizes that any investigation, 
examination or inspection of the Property is within the control of the owner, tenants or other 
parties in possession of the Property and not within the control of the Substitute Trustees 
or Beneﬁciary.
Conveyance shall be by Substitute Trustee’s deed, without covenant or warranty, express 
or implied. The risk of loss or damage by ﬁre or other casualty to the Property from and 
after the time of sale will be upon the successful purchaser. The Property is sold subject to 
all taxes, ground rents, public space rental, business improvement taxes, public charges, 
assessments, ﬁnes, notices of violation or infractions, sewer, water, drainage and other 
public charges, if any, whether assessments have been levied or not, and whether accrued 
prior to or after the sale, and all unfunded lease and capital improvement costs, if any, 
all of which shall be the sole responsibility of the successful purchaser. Beneﬁciary and 
Substitute Trustees assume no liability for fuel, gas, electricity, utilities and other operating 
charges accrued before or after the sale and all such charges shall be the sole responsibility 
of the successful purchaser from the date of sale. All costs incident to the settlement and 
conveyancing including, without limitation, examination of title, conveyancing, all (i) 
recordation taxes, fees and charges, (ii) transfer taxes, fees and charges, (iii) title insurance 
premiums, (iv) notary fees, (v) settlement and escrow fees, and (vi) all other fees, costs 
and charges incident to settlement shall be at the sole cost of the successful purchaser. 
If the Substitute Trustees cannot convey title, the purchaser’s sole remedy is a return of 
the deposit without interest. Further particulars may be announced at the time of sale. For 
further information, please contact Paul Cooper at paul@alexcooper.com or 410-977-4707.

simple, being more particularly described in the Deed of 
Trust, and generally known as 2670 W. University Boulevard,

TERMS OF SALE:  A deposit in the amount of Twenty Thousand 
Dollars ($20,000.00), payable in the form of cashier’s check, 
certiﬁed check, or other form acceptable to the Substitute

The deposit must be increased to 10% of the purchase price

afﬁliate thereof, is the successful bidder at the sale, such 
party will not be required to make a deposit or to pay interest 
on the unpaid purchase money.  Taxes, water rent, ground 
rent, if any, and all other municipal charges and liens 
owed against the Property shall be the sole responsibility 
of the purchaser(s) and shall be paid by the purchaser(s) 
at settlement.  In addition, all other charges, expenses and 
liens owed against the Property including, but not limited 
to, all condominium fees and expenses and public charges 
and assessments owed against the Property and payable 
on an annual basis, such as sanitary and/or metropolitan 
district charges, if any, shall also be the responsibility of 
the purchaser(s) and shall be paid by the purchaser(s)

to reject any and all bids, and to extend the time for 
settlement, if applicable.  In the event any taxes or other

be adjusted as of the date of the foreclosure sale.
The Property will be sold in an “AS IS” condition and 
without any warranties or representations, either express 
or implied, as to the nature, condition or description of the 
improvements.  In addition, the Property will also be sold

subject to all critical area and wetland violations, subject to 
all environmental problems and violations which may exist

and restrictions of record affecting the same, if any.  The 
purchaser(s) at the foreclosure sale shall assume the risk of 
loss for the above-referenced Property immediately after the 
sale takes place. It shall be the purchaser(s)’ responsibility 
to obtain possession of the Property following ratiﬁcation 
of the sale by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, 
Maryland.
The Property will be sold subject to all of the following that 
are not extinguished as a matter of law by the foreclosure 
sale: all easements, conditions, liens, restrictions, rights 
of redemption, covenants, encumbrances, ground rents, 
ground leases, such state of facts that an accurate survey 
or physical inspection of the Property might disclose, and 
agreements of record affecting the same, if any.
The purchaser(s) shall pay all documentary stamps, state 
and local transfer taxes, recordation taxes and fees, title 
examination costs, attorneys’ fees, conveyance fees and all 
other incidental settlement costs.  The purchaser(s) shall 
settle and comply with the sale terms within twenty (20) 
days following the ﬁnal ratiﬁcation of sale by the Circuit 
Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, unless said period 
is extended by the Substitute Trustees for good cause 
shown.  Time is of the essence.
In the event the purchaser(s) fails to go to settlement as 
required, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies 
available, the Substitute Trustees may, without further order 
of the court, declare the aforementioned deposit forfeited 
and resell the Property at the purchaser’s sole risk and 
expense.  In such event, the defaulting purchaser(s) shall 
be liable for the payment of any deﬁciency in the purchase 
price, all costs and expenses of both sales, reasonable 
attorneys’ fees, all other charges due, and incidental 
damages.  The parties’ respective rights and obligations 
regarding the terms of sale and the conduct of the sale shall 
be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the 
State of Maryland.
If the Substitute Trustees are unable to convey the Property 
as described above, the purchaser(s)’ sole remedy at law or 
in equity shall be limited to the refund of the aforementioned 
deposit, without interest thereon.  Upon refund of the 
deposit to the purchaser(s), the sale shall be void and of 
no effect, and the purchaser(s) shall have no further claim 
against the Substitute Trustees or the Noteholder.

deemed to be reliable, but is offered for informational

of the sale is denied by the Circuit Court for any reason, the
